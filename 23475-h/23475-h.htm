<h2 style="font-size:smaller;">TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES</h2>

<p>The source code for this HTML page contains only ASCII characters, but
it directs the browser to display some special characters. The original
work contained a few phrases or lines of Greek text. These are
represented here as Greek letters, for example <span
title="tragos">&#964;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>. If the mouse is
held still over such phrases, a transliteration in Beta-code pops up.
Aside from Greek letters, the only special characters are a few
scattered instances of the letters a, e, s, and z with a breve, and the
letters a and u with a macron.</p>

<p>An important feature of this edition is its copious footnotes. Footnotes
are indicated by small raised keys in brackets; these are links to the
footnote's text. Footnotes indexed with arabic numbers (as [17],
[221]) are informational. Note text in square brackets is the work of
editor E. H. Coleridge. Unbracketed note text is from earlier editions
and is by a preceding editor or Byron himself. Footnotes indexed with
letters (as [c], [bf]) document variant forms of the text from
manuscripts and other sources.</p>

<p>In the original, footnotes were printed at the foot of the page on which
they were referenced, and their indices started over on each page. In
this etext, footnotes have been collected at the ends of each play or
poem, and have been numbered consecutively throughout.</p>

<p>Navigation aids are provided as follows. Page numbers are displayed at
the right edge of the window. To jump directly to page <i>nn</i>, append
#Page_<i>nn</i> to the document URL.
To jump directly to the text of footnote <i>xx</i>, either search for [<i>xx</i>]
or append #Footnote_<i>xx</i> to the document URL.</p>

<p>Within the blocks of footnotes, numbers in braces such as {321}
represent the page number on which following notes originally appeared.
These numbers are also preserved as HTML anchors of the form Note_321.
To find a note that was originally printed on page <i>nn</i>, either search
for the string {<i>nn</i>} or append #Note_<i>nn</i> to the document URL.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE_TO_THE_FIFTH_VOLUME" id="PREFACE_TO_THE_FIFTH_VOLUME"></a>PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.</h2>

<p>
<span class="smcap">The</span> plays and poems contained in this volume were written within the
space of two years&mdash;the last two years of Byron's career as a poet. But
that was not all. Cantos VI.-XV. of <i>Don Juan</i>, <i>The Vision of
Judgment</i>, <i>The Blues</i>, <i>The Irish Avatar</i>, and other minor poems,
belong to the same period. The end was near, and, as though he had
received a warning, he hastened to make the roll complete.</p>

<p>Proof is impossible, but the impression remains that the greater part of
this volume has been passed over and left unread by at least two
generations of readers. Old play-goers recall Macready as "Werner," and
many persons have read <i>Cain</i>; but apart from students of literature,
readers of <i>Sardanapalus</i> and of <i>The Two Foscari</i> are rare; of <i>The Age
of Bronze</i> and <i>The Island</i> rarer still. A few of Byron's later poems
have shared the fate of Southey's epics; and, yet, with something of
Southey's persistence, Byron believed that posterity would weigh his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
"regular dramas" in a fresh balance, and that his heedless critics
would kick the beam. But "can these bones live"? Can dramas which
excited the wondering admiration of Goethe and Lamartine and Sir Walter
Scott touch or lay hold of the more adventurous reader of the present
day? It is certain that even the half-forgotten works of a great and
still popular poet, which have left their mark on the creative
imagination of the poets and playwrights of three quarters of a century,
will always be studied by the few from motives of curiosity, or for
purposes of reference; but it is improbable, though not impossible, that
in the revolution of taste and sentiment, moribund or extinct poetry
will be born again into the land of the living. Poetry which has never
had its day, such as Blake's <i>Songs of Innocence</i>, the <i>Lyrical
Ballads</i>, or Fitzgerald's <i>Omar Khayy&aacute;m</i>, may come, in due time, to be
recognized at its full worth; but it is a harder matter for a poem which
has lost its vogue to recapture the interest and enthusiasm of the many.</p>

<p>Byron is only an instance in point. Bygone poetry has little or no
attraction for modern readers. This poem or that drama may be referred
to, and occasionally examined in the interests of general culture, or in
support of a particular belief or line of conduct, as a classical or
quasi-scriptural authority; but, with the rarest exceptions, plays and
narrative poems are not read spontaneously or with any genuine
satisfaction or delight. An old-world poem which will not yield up its
secret to the idle <i>reader</i> "of an empty day" is more or less
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span> "rudely
dismissed," without even a show of favour or hospitality.</p>

<p>And yet these forgotten works of the imagination are full of hidden
treasures! There is not one of Byron's "impressionist studies" of
striking episodes of history or historical legend, flung, as it were,
with a "Take it or leave it" in the face of friend or foe, which does
not transform names and shadows into persons and substance, which does
not contain lines and passages of unquestionable beauty and distinction.
</p><p>
But some would have it that Byron's plays, as a whole, are dull and
uninspiring, monotonous harpings on worn-out themes, which every one has
mastered or wishes to forget. A close study of the text, together with
some knowledge of the subject as it presented itself to the author and
arrested <i>his</i> attention, may compel these impatient critics to a
different conclusion. Byron did not scruple to refer the reader to his
"sources," and was at pains to publish, in the notes and appendices to
his dramas and poems, long extracts from old chronicles, from Plutarch's
<i>Lives</i>, from French and Italian histories, which he had read himself,
and, as he fondly believed, would be read by others, who were willing to
submit themselves to his guidance. He expected his readers to take some
trouble and to display some intelligence.</p>

<p>Poetry is successful only so far as it is intelligible. To a clear cry
an answer comes, but not to a muffled call. The reader who comes within
speaking distance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span> of his author can hear him, and to bring the living
within speaking distance of the dead, the living must know the facts,
and understand the ideas which informed and inspired the dead. Thought
and attention are scarcely to be reckoned among necromantic arts, but
thought and knowledge "can make these bones live," and stand upon their
feet, if they do not leap and sing.</p>

<p>I desire to renew my acknowledgments of the generous assistance of the
officials of the British Museum, and, more especially, of Mr. Ernest
Wallis Budge, Litt.D., M.A., <i>Keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian
Antiquities</i>; of Mr. Leonard W. King, M.A., of the same department; and
of Mr. George F. Barwick, <i>Superintendent of the Reading Room</i>.</p>

<p>To Dr. Garnett, C.B., I am greatly indebted for invaluable hints and
suggestions with regard to the interpretation of some obscure passages
in <i>The Age of Bronze</i> and other parts of the volume, and for reading
the proofs of the "Introduction" and "Note to the Introduction to
<i>Werner</i>."</p>

<p>I have also to acknowledge the assistance and advice of Mr. W. Hale
White, and of my friend Mr. Frank E. Taylor, of Chertsey.</p>

<p>For assistance during the preparation of the volume, and more especially
in the revision of proofs, I desire to express my cordial thanks to Mr.
John Murray.</p>

[<i>Sardanapale, Trag&eacute;die Imit&eacute;e de Lord Byron</i>, par L. Alvin, was
performed at the Th&eacute;atre Royal at Brussels, January 13, 16, 1834.</p>

<p><i>Sardanapalus</i>, a Tragedy, was played for the first time at Drury Lane
Theatre, April 10, 1834, and (for the twenty-second time) June 5, 1834.
Macready appeared as "Sardanapalus," Miss Phillips as "Zarina," and Miss
Ellen Tree as "Myrrha." [In his diary for April 11, 1834 (see
<i>Reminiscences</i>, 1875, i. 414, 415) Macready wrote, "On arriving at my
chambers ... I found a letter without a signature; the seal was the head
of Byron, and in the envelope was a folded sheet with merely the words,
'Werner, Nov., 1830. Byron, Ravenna, 1821,' and 'Sardanapalus, April
10th, 1834.' Encircling the name of Byron, etc., was a lock of grey hair
fastened by a gold thread, which I am sure was Byron's, ... it surprised
and pleased me."]</p>

<p><i>Sardanapalus, King of Assyria</i>, was produced at the Princess's Theatre,
June 13, 1853, and played till September 2, 1853. Charles Kean appeared
as "Sardanapalus," Miss Heath as "Zarina," and Mrs. Charles Kean as
"Myrrha."</p>

<p><i>Sardanapale, Op&eacute;ra en Trois Actes</i>, par M. Henry Becque, Musique de M.
Victorin Jonci&egrave;res, was performed for the first time at the Th&egrave;atre
Imp&eacute;rial-Lyrique, February 8, 1867.</p>

<p><i>Lord Byron's Tragedy of Sardanapalus</i>, in four acts, was performed at
the Theatre Royal, Manchester, March 31-April 28, 1877. Charles Calvert
(the adapter) played "Sardanapalus," Miss Hathaway "Zarina," and Miss
Fanny Ensor "Myrrha;" and June 26-July 27, 1877, at the Royal Alexandra
Theatre, Liverpool. Calvert's adaptation was also performed at Booth's
Theatre, New York.]</p>

INTRODUCTION TO <i>SARDANAPALUS</i>
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Byron's</span> passion or infatuation for the regular drama lasted a little
over a year. <i>Marino Faliero</i>, <i>Sardanapalus</i>, and the <i>Two Foscari</i>,
were the fruits of his "self-denying ordinance to dramatize, like the
Greeks ... striking passages of history" (letter to Murray, July 14,
1821, <i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 323). The mood was destined to pass, but for a
while the neophyte was spell-bound.</p>

<p><i>Sardanapalus, a Tragedy</i>, the second and, perhaps, the most successful
of these studies in the poetry of history, was begun at Ravenna, January
13, 1821, "with all deliberate speed;" but, for a time, from laziness or
depression of spirits, or, perhaps, from the counter-excitement of "the
poetry of politics" (<i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 205), that is, the
revolutionary drama which had begun to run its course, a month went by
before he had finished the first act (February 15). Three months later
(May 28) he announces the completion of the drama, the last act having
been "dashed off" in two or three days (<i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 300).</p>

<p>For the story of Sardanapalus, which had excited his interest as a
schoolboy, Byron consulted the pages of Diodorus Siculus (<i>Bibliothec&aelig;
Historic&aelig;</i>, lib. ii. pp. 78, sq., ed. 1604), and, possibly to ward off
and neutralize the distracting influence of Shakespeare and other
barbarian dramatists, he "turned over" the tragedies of Seneca
(<i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 173). It is hardly necessary to remind the modern
reader that the Sardanapalus of history is an unverified if not an
unverifiable personage. Diodorus the Sicilian, who was contemporary with
Cicero, derived his knowledge of Assyrian history from the <i>Persica</i> of
Ctesias of Cnidos, who was private physician at the court of Artaxerxes
Mnemon (B.C. 405-359), and is said to have had access to, and to have
consulted, the "Persian authorities"
(<span title="diphthe/rai Basilikai\">&#948;&#953;&#966;&#952;&#8051;&#961;&#945;&#953;
&#914;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span>).
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
The character which Ctesias depicted or invented, an effeminate
debauchee, sunk in luxury and sloth, who at the last was driven to take
up arms, and, after a prolonged but ineffectual resistance, avoided
capture by suicide, cannot be identified. Asurbanipal
(A&#353;ur-b&#257;ni-apli), the son of Esarhaddon and grandson of
Sennacherib, who ascended the throne B.C. 668, and reigned for about
forty years, was, as the cuneiform records and the friezes of his palace
testify, a bold hunter and a mighty warrior. He vanquished Tarku
(Tirhakah) of Ethiopia, and his successor, Urdamane. Ba'al King of Tyre,
Yakinl&#363; King of the island-city of Arvad, Sand&#259;sarm&#363; of Cilicia,
Teumman of Elam, and other potentates, suffered defeat at his hands.
"The land of Elam," writes the king or his "Historiographer Royal,"
"through its extent I covered as when a mighty storm approaches; I cut
off the head of Teumman, their king.... Beyond number I slew his
warriors; alive in my hands I took his fighting men; with their corpses,
as with thorns and thistles, I filled the vicinity of Susa; their blood
I caused to flow in the Eul&aelig;us, and I stained its waters like wool."
Clearly the Sardanapalus who painted his face and carded purple wool in
the <i>penetralia</i> of his seraglio does not bear even a traditional
resemblance to A&#353;ur-b&#257;ni-apli the Conqueror.</p>

<p>All that can be affirmed with any certainty is that within twenty years
of the death of Asurbanipal, the Assyrian Empire passed into the hands
of the Medes;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> but there is nothing to show whether the period of
decay had already set in before the close of his reign, or under which
of his two successors, &#258;sur-etil-il&#257;ni or Sin-&#353;ar-i&#353;kun,
the final catastrophe (B.C. 606) took place (<i>Encyclopedia Biblica</i>,
art. "Assyria," art. "&#258;sur-bani-pal," by Leonard W. King).</p>

<p>"I have made," writes Byron (May 25, 1821), "Sardanapalus brave though
voluptuous (as history represents him), and as amiable as my poor pen
could make him." Diodorus, or rather Ctesias, who may have drawn upon
personal reminiscences of his patron, Artaxerxes Mnemon (see Plutarch's
<i>Artaxerxes</i>, <i>passim</i>), does not enlarge upon his amiability, and
credits him only with the courage of despair. Byron's Sardanapalus, with
his sudden transition from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> voluptuous abandonment to heroic chivalry,
his remorseful recognition of the sanctities of wedlock, his general
good nature, his "sly, insinuating sarcasms" (Moore's Diary, September
30, 1821, <i>Memoirs</i>, iii. 282), "all made out of the carver's brain,"
resembles <i>history</i> as little as <i>history</i> resembles the Assyrian
record. Fortunately, the genius of the poet escaped from the meshes
which he had woven round himself, and, in spite of himself, he was
constrained to "beat his music out," regardless of his authorities.</p>

<p>The character of Myrrha, which bears some resemblance to Aspasia, "a
native of Phocea in Ionia&mdash;the favourite mistress of Cyrus" (see
Plutarch's <i>Artaxerxes</i>, Langhorne's Translation, 1838, p. 699), was
introduced partly to pacify the Countess Guiccioli, who had quarrelled
with him for maintaining that "love was not the loftiest theme for true
tragedy," and, in part, to prove that he was not a slave to his own
ideals, and could imagine and delineate a woman who was both passionate
and high-minded. Diodorus (<i>Bibl. Hist.</i>, lib. iii. p. 130) records the
exploits of Myrina, Queen of the Amazons, but it is probable that Byron
named his Ionian slave after Mirra, who gives her name to Alfieri's
tragedy, which brought on a convulsive fit of tears and shuddering when
he first saw it played at Bologna in August, 1819 (<i>Letters</i>, 1900, iv.
339).</p>

<p><i>Sardanapalus, a Tragedy</i>, was published together with <i>The Two Foscari,
a Tragedy</i>, and <i>Cain, a Mystery</i>, December 19, 1821.</p>

<p>The three plays were reviewed by Heber in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, July,
1822, vol. xxvii. pp. 476-524; by Jeffrey in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
February, 1822, vol. 36, pp. 413-452; in <i>Blackwood's Edinburgh
Magazine</i>, February, 1822, vol. xi. pp. 212-217; and in the <i>Portfolio</i>
(Philadelphia), December, 1822, vol. xiv. pp. 487-492.</p>

<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> publishing the following
Tragedies<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
I have only to repeat, that
they were not composed with the most remote view to the stage. On the
attempt made by the managers in a former instance, the public opinion
has been already expressed. With regard to my own private feelings, as
it seems that they are to stand for nothing, I shall say nothing.</p>

<p>For the historical foundation of the following compositions the reader
is referred to the Notes.</p>

<p>The Author has in one instance attempted to preserve, and in the other
to approach, the "unities;" conceiving that with any very distant
departure from them, there may be poetry, but can be no drama. He is
aware of the unpopularity of this notion in present English literature;
but it is not a system of his own, being merely an opinion, which, not
very long ago, was the law of literature throughout the world, and is
still so in the more civilised parts of it. But "nous avons chang&eacute; tout
cela," and are reaping the advantages of the change. The writer is far
from conceiving that any thing he can adduce by personal precept or
example can at all approach his regular, or even irregular predecessors:
he is merely giving a reason why he preferred the more regular formation
of a structure, however feeble, to an entire abandonment of all rules
whatsoever. Where he has failed, the failure is in the architect,&mdash;and
not in the art.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
In this tragedy it has been my intention to follow the account of
Diodorus Siculus;<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
reducing it, however, to such dramatic regularity
as I best could, and trying to approach the unities. I therefore suppose
the rebellion to explode and succeed in one day by a sudden conspiracy,
instead of the long war of the history.</p>

<p>The Sun goes down: methinks he sets more slowly,</p>
<p>Taking his last look of Assyria's Empire.</p>

<p>Like the blood he predicts. If not in vain,</p>

<p>Hour of Assyria's years. And yet how calm!</p>
<p>An earthquake should announce so great a fall&mdash;<span class="linenum">10</span></p>
<p>A summer's sun discloses it. Yon disk,</p>
<p>To the star-read Chaldean, bears upon</p>
<p>Its everlasting page the end of what</p>
<p>Seemed everlasting; but oh! thou true Sun!</p>
<p>The burning oracle of all that live,</p>
<p>As fountain of all life, and symbol of</p>
<p>Him who bestows it, wherefore dost thou limit</p>
<p>Thy lore unto calamity? Why not</p>
<p>Unfold the rise of days more worthy thine</p>
<p>All-glorious burst from ocean? why not dart<span class="linenum">20</span></p>
<p>A beam of hope athwart the future years,</p>
<p>As of wrath to its days? Hear me! oh, hear me!</p>
<p>I am thy worshipper, thy priest, thy servant&mdash;</p>
<p>I have gazed on thee at thy rise and fall,</p>
<p>And bowed my head beneath thy mid-day beams,</p>
<p>When my eye dared not meet thee. I have watched</p>
<p>For thee, and after thee, and prayed to thee,</p>
<p>And sacrificed to thee, and read, and feared thee,</p>
<p>And asked of thee, and thou hast answered&mdash;but</p>
<p>Only to thus much: while I speak, he sinks&mdash;<span class="linenum">30</span></p>
<p>Is gone&mdash;and leaves his beauty, not his knowledge,</p>
<p>To the delighted West, which revels in</p>
<p>Its hues of dying glory. Yet what is</p>
<p>Death, so it be but glorious? 'Tis a sunset;</p>
<p>And mortals may be happy to resemble</p>

<p><i>Myr</i>. (<i>sola, gazing</i>). I have stolen upon his rest, if rest it be,</p>
<p>Which thus convulses slumber: shall I wake him?</p>
<p>No, he seems calmer. Oh, thou God of Quiet!</p>
<p>Whose reign is o'er sealed eyelids and soft dreams,</p>
<p>Or deep, deep sleep, so as to be unfathomed,</p>
<p>Look like thy brother, Death,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>&mdash;so still, so stirless&mdash;</p>

<p>Of thy stern, silent, and unwakening Twin.</p>
<p>Again he moves&mdash;again the play of pain<span class="linenum">10</span></p>

<p>Crisps the reluctant lake that lay so calm<a name="FNanchor_ac" id="FNanchor_ac"></a><a href="#Footnote_ac" class="fnanchor">[ac]</a></p>
<p>Beneath the mountain shadow; or the blast</p>
<p>Ruffles the autumn leaves, that drooping cling</p>
<p>Faintly and motionless to their loved boughs.</p>
<p>I must awake him&mdash;yet not yet; who knows</p>
<p>From what I rouse him? It seems pain; but if</p>
<p>I quicken him to heavier pain? The fever</p>
<p>Of this tumultuous night, the grief too of</p>
<p>His wound, though slight, may cause all this, and shake<span class="linenum">20</span></p>
<p>Me more to see than him to suffer. No:</p>

<p>Willing to equal all in social freedom;</p>
<p>But, on my right hand and my left, instead</p>
<p>Of thee and Zames, and our customed meeting,</p>
<p>Was ranged on my left hand a haughty, dark,</p>
<p>And deadly face; I could not recognise it,</p>
<p>Yet I had seen it, though I knew not where:</p>
<p>The features were a Giant's, and the eye</p>
<p>Was still, yet lighted; his long locks curled down</p>
<p>On his vast bust, whence a huge quiver rose</p>
<p>With shaft-heads feathered from the eagle's wing,<span class="linenum">90</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<p>That peeped up bristling through his serpent hair.<a name="FNanchor_ae" id="FNanchor_ae"></a><a href="#Footnote_ae" class="fnanchor">[ae]</a></p>
<p>I invited him to fill the cup which stood</p>
<p>Between us, but he answered not; I filled it;</p>
<p>He took it not, but stared upon me, till</p>
<p>I trembled at the fixed glare of his eye:</p>
<p>I frowned upon him as a king should frown;</p>
<p>He frowned not in his turn, but looked upon me</p>
<p>With the same aspect, which appalled me more,</p>
<p>Because it changed not; and I turned for refuge</p>
<p>To milder guests, and sought them on the right,<span class="linenum">100</span></p>
<p>Where thou wert wont to be. But&mdash;&mdash;<span class="ilsd">[<i>He pauses</i>.</span></p>

<p>And bloody-handed, ghastly, ghostly thing,</p>
<p>Female in garb, and crowned upon the brow,</p>
<p>Furrowed with years, yet sneering with the passion</p>
<p>Of vengeance, leering too with that of lust,</p>

<p>Her left, another, filled with&mdash;what I saw not,</p>

<p>The table sate a range of crown&eacute;d wretches,</p>
<p>Of various aspects, but of one expression.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Sar</i>.<span class="s32">&zwj;</span>No:</p>

<p>Till I grew stone, as they seemed half to be,</p>
<p>Yet breathing stone, for I felt life in them,</p>
<p>And life in me: there was a horrid kind</p>
<p>Of sympathy between us, as if they</p>
<p>Had lost a part of death to come to me,</p>
<p>And I the half of life to sit by them.</p>
<p>We were in an existence all apart</p>
<p>From heaven or earth&mdash;&mdash;And rather let me see</p>
<p>Death all than such a being!</p>

</div><div class="stanza">

<p>Yes, the enlarged but noble aspect of</p>

<p>His lips, for his eyes moved not&mdash;and the woman's</p>
<p>Thin lips relaxed to something like a smile.</p>
<p>Both rose, and the crowned figures on each hand</p>
<p>Rose also, as if aping their chief shades&mdash;</p>
<p>Mere mimics even in death&mdash;but I sate still:</p>
<p>A desperate courage crept through every limb,<span class="linenum">140</span></p>
<p>And at the last I feared them not, but laughed</p>
<p>Full in their phantom faces. But then&mdash;then</p>
<p>The Hunter laid his hand on mine: I took it,</p>
<p>And grasped it&mdash;but it melted from my own;</p>
<p>While he too vanished, and left nothing but</p>
<p>The memory of a hero, for he looked so.</p>

<p>And, flinging down the goblets on each hand,</p>
<p>Methought their poisons flowed around us, till</p>
<p>Each formed a hideous river. Still she clung;</p>
<p>The other phantoms, like a row of statues,</p>
<p>Stood dull as in our temples, but she still</p>
<p>Embraced me, while I shrunk from her, as if,</p>
<p>In lieu of her remote descendant, I</p>
<p>Had been the son who slew her for her incest.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The day at last has broken. What a night</p>
<p>Hath ushered it! How beautiful in heaven!</p>
<p>Though varied with a transitory storm,</p>
<p>More beautiful in that variety!</p>
<p>How hideous upon earth! where Peace and Hope,</p>

<p>Vapours more lovely than the unclouded sky,</p>
<p>With golden pinnacles, and snowy mountains,</p>
<p>And billows purpler than the Ocean's, making</p>

<p>Beyond a vision, 'tis so transiently</p>

"Another king of the sort was Sardanapalus.... And so, when Arbaces, who
was one of the generals under him, a Mede by birth, endeavoured to
manage by the assistance of one of the eunuchs, whose name was
Sparamizus, to see Sardanapalus: and when ... he saw him painted with
vermilion, and adorned like a woman, sitting among his concubines,
carding purple wool, and sitting among them with his feet up, wearing a
woman's robe, and with his beard carefully scraped, and his face
smoothed with pumice stone (for he was whiter than milk, and pencilled
under his eyes and eyebrows; and when he saw Arbaces he was putting a
little more white under his eyes). Most historians, of whom Duris is
one, relate that Arbaces, being indignant at his countrymen being ruled
over by such a monarch as that, stabbed him and slew him. But Ctesias
says that he went to war with him, and collected a great army, and then
that Sardanapalus, being dethroned by Arbaces, died, burning himself
alive in his palace, having heaped up a funeral pile four plethra in
extent, on which he placed 150 golden couches."&mdash;<i>The Deipnosophist&aelig;</i>

effeminacy, luxury, and cowardice. He never went out of his palace, but
spent all his time among a company of women, dressed and painted like
them, and employed like them at the distaff. He placed all his happiness
and glory in the possession of immense treasures, in feasting and
rioting, and indulging himself in all the most infamous and criminal
pleasures. He ordered two verses to be put upon his tomb, signifying
that he carried away with him all he had eaten, and all the pleasures he
had enjoyed, but left everything else behind him,&mdash;<i>an epitaph</i>, says
Aristotle, <i>fit for a hog</i>. Arbaces, governor of Media, having found
means to get into the palace, and having with his own eyes seen
Sardanapalus in the midst of his infamous seraglio, enraged at such a
spectacle, and not able to endure that so many brave men should be
subjected to a prince more soft and effeminate than the women
themselves, immediately formed a conspiracy against him. Beleses,
governor of Babylon, and several others, entered into it. On the first
rumour of this revolt the king hid himself in the inmost part of his
palace. Being afterwards obliged to take the field with some forces
which he had assembled, he at first gained three successive victories
over the enemy, but was afterwards overcome, and pursued to the gates of
Nineveh; wherein he shut himself, in hopes the rebels would never be
able to take a city so well fortified, and stored with provisions for a
considerable time. The siege proved indeed of very great length. It had
been declared by an ancient oracle that Nineveh could never be taken
unless the river became an enemy to the city. These words buoyed up
Sardanapalus, because he looked upon the thing as impossible. But when
he saw that the Tigris, by a violent inundation, had thrown down twenty
stadia (two miles and a half) of the city wall, and by that means opened
a passage to the enemy, he understood the meaning of the oracle, and
thought himself lost. He resolved, however, to die in such a manner as,
according to his opinion, should cover the infamy of his scandalous and
effeminate life. He ordered a pile of wood to be made in his palace,
and, setting fire to it, burnt himself, his eunuchs, his women, and his
treasures.&mdash;Diod. Sic., <i>Bibl. Hist</i>., lib. ii. pag. 78, sqq., ed. 1604,

Byron pretended, or, perhaps, really thought, that such a phrase as the
"Queen's wrongs" would be supposed to contain an allusion to the trial
of Queen Caroline (August-November, 1820), and to the exclusion of her
name from the State prayers, etc. Unquestionably if the play had been
put on the stage at this time, the pit and gallery would have applauded
the sentiment to the echo. There was, too, but one "pavilion" in 1821,
and that was not on the banks of the Euphrates, but at Brighton. <i>Qui

the phalanx, but all his light troops. In the first day's march he
reached Anchialus, a town said to have been founded by the king of
Assyria, Sardanapalus. The fortifications, in their magnitude and
extent, still in Arrian's time, bore the character of greatness, which
the Assyrians appear singularly to have affected in works of the kind. A
monument representing Sardanapalus was found there, warranted by an
inscription in Assyrian characters, of course in the old Assyrian
language, which the Greeks, whether well or ill, interpreted thus:
'Sardanapalus, son of Anacyndaraxes, in one day founded Anchialus and
Tarsus. Eat, drink, play; all other human joys are not worth a fillip.'
Supposing this version nearly exact (for Arrian says it was not quite
so), whether the purpose has not been to invite to civil order a people
disposed to turbulence, rather than to recommend immoderate luxury, may
perhaps reasonably be questioned. What, indeed, could be the object of a
king of Assyria in founding such towns in a country so distant from his
capital, and so divided from it by an immense extent of sandy deserts
and lofty mountains, and, still more, how the inhabitants could be at
once in circumstances to abandon themselves to the intemperate joys
which their prince has been supposed to have recommended, is not
obvious. But it may deserve observation that, in that line of coast, the
southern of Lesser Asia, ruins of cities, evidently of an age after
Alexander, yet barely named in history, at this day astonish the
adventurous traveller by their magnificence and elegance amid the
desolation which, under a singularly barbarian government, has for so
many centuries been daily spreading in the finest countries of the
globe. Whether more from soil and climate, or from opportunities for
commerce, extraordinary means must have been found for communities to
flourish there; whence it may seem that the measures of Sardanapalus
were directed by juster views than have been commonly ascribed to him.
But that monarch having been the last of a dynasty ended by a
revolution, obloquy on his memory would follow of course from the policy
of his successors and their partisans. The inconsistency of traditions
concerning Sardanapalus is striking in Diodorus's account of
him."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mitford'</span>s <i>Greece</i>, 1820, ix. 311-313, and note 1.

[The story of the sepulchral monument with its cynical inscription rests
on the authority of Aristobulus, who served under Alexander, and wrote
his history. The passage is quoted by Strabo (lib. xiv. ed. 1808, p.
958), and as follows by Athen&aelig;us (lib. xii. cap. 40) in the
<i>Deipnosophist&aelig;</i>: "And Aristobulus says, 'In Anchiale, which was built
by Sardanapalus, did Alexander, when he was on his expedition against
the Persians, pitch his camp. And at no great distance was the monument
of Sardanapalus, on which there is a marble figure putting together the
fingers of its right hand, as if it were giving a fillip. And there was
on it the following inscription in Assyrian characters:&mdash;

But the difference, even in form, between the two passages is more
remarkable than the resemblance, and the interpretation, the moral of
Byron's vision is distinct from, if not alien to, Wordsworth's. The
"Solitary" sees all heaven opened; the revealed abode of spirits in
beatitude&mdash;a refuge and a redemption from "this low world of care;"
while Myrrha drinks in "enough of heaven," a medicament of "Sorrow and
of Love," for the invigoration of "the common, heavy, human hours" of
mortal existence. For a charge of "imitation," see <i>Works of Lord
Byron</i>, 1832, xiii. 172, note I. See, too, <i>Poetical Works, etc.</i>, 1891,

governor Boges, who burnt himself with his wives and children at Eion

INTRODUCTION TO <i>THE TWO FOSCARI</i>
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Two Foscari</i> was begun on June 12, and finished, within the month,
on July 9, 1821. Byron was still in the vein of the historic drama,
though less concerned with "ancient chroniclers" and original
"authorities" (<i>vide ante</i>, Preface to <i>Marino Faliero</i>, vol. iv. p. 332)
than heretofore. "The Venetian play," he tells Murray, July 14, 1821, is
"rigidly historical;" but he seems to have depended for his facts, not
on Sanudo or Navagero, but on Daru's <i>Histoire de la R&eacute;publique de
V&eacute;nise</i> (1821, ii. 520-537), and on Sismondi's <i>Histoire des R&eacute;publiques
... du Moyen Age</i> (1815, x. 36-46). The story of the Two Doges, so far
as it concerns the characters and action of Byron's play, may be briefly
re-told. It will be found to differ in some important particulars from
the extracts from Daru and Sismondi which Byron printed in his "Appendix
to the <i>Two Foscari</i>" (<i>Sardanapalus, etc.</i>, 1821, pp. 305-324), and no
less from a passage in Smedley's <i>Sketches from Venetian History</i> (1832,
ii. 93-105), which was substituted for the French "Pi&egrave;ces
justificatives," in the collected edition of 1832-1835, xiii. 198-202,
and the octavo edition of 1837, etc., pp. 790, 791.</p>

<p>Francesco, son of Nicol&ograve; Foscari, was born in 1373. He was nominated a
member of the Council of Ten in 1399, and, after holding various offices
of state, elected Doge in 1423. His dukedom, the longest on record,
lasted till 1457. He was married, in 1395, to Maria, daughter of Andrea
Priuli, and, <i>en secondes noces</i>, to Maria, or Marina, daughter of
Bartolommeo Nani. By his two wives he was the father of ten
children&mdash;five sons and five daughters. Of the five sons, four died of
the plague, and the fifth, Jacopo, lived to be the cause, if not the
hero, of a tragedy.</p>

<p>The younger of the "Two Foscari" was a man of some cultivation, a
collector and student of Greek manuscripts, well-mannered, and of ready
wit, a child and lover of Venice, but indifferent to her ideals and
regardless of her prejudices and restrictions. He seems to have begun
life in a blaze of popularity, the admired of all admirers. His wedding
with Lucrezia Contarini (January, 1441) was celebrated with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> novel and
peculiar splendour. Gorgeous youths, Companions of the Hose (<i>della
calza</i>), in jackets of crimson velvet, with slashed sleeves lined with
squirrel fur, preceded and followed the bridegroom's train. A hundred
bridesmaids accompanied the bride. Her dowry exceeded 16,000 ducats, and
her jewels, which included a necklace worn by a Queen of Cyprus, were
"rich and rare." And the maiden herself was a pearl of great price. "She
behaved," writes her brother, "and does behave, so well beyond what
could have been looked for. I believe she is inspired by God!"</p>

<p>Jacopo had everything which fortune could bestow, but he lacked a
capacity for right conduct. Four years after his marriage (February 17,
1445) an accusation was laid before the Ten (Romanin, <i>Storia</i>, etc.,
iv. 266) that, contrary to the law embodied in the Ducal <i>Promissione</i>,
he had accepted gifts of jewels and money, not only from his
fellow-citizens, but from his country's bitterest enemy, Filippo
Visconti, Duke of Milan. Jacopo fled to Trieste, and in his absence the
Ten, supported by a giunta of ten, on their own authority and
independently of the Doge, sentenced him to perpetual banishment at
Nauplia, in Roumania. One of the three <i>Capi di' dieci</i> was Ermolao (or
<i>Venetic&eacute;</i> Almoro) Donato, of whom more hereafter. It is to be noted
that this sentence was never carried into effect. At the end of four
months, thanks to the intervention of five members of the Ten, he was
removed from Trieste to Treviso, and, two years later (September 13,
1447), out of consideration to the Doge, who pleaded that the exile of
his only son prevented him from giving his whole heart and soul to the
Republic, permitted to return to Venice. So ends the first chapter of
Jacopo's misadventures. He stands charged with unlawful, if not
criminal, appropriation of gifts and moneys. He had been punished, but
less than he deserved, and, for his father's sake, the sentence of exile
had been altogether remitted.</p>

<p>Three years went by, and once again, January, 1451, a charge was
preferred against Jacopo Foscari, and on this occasion he was arrested
and brought before the Ten. He was accused of being implicated in the
murder of Ermolao Donato, who was assassinated November 5, 1450, on
leaving the Ducal Palace, where he had been attending the Council of the
Pregadi. On the morning after the murder Benedetto Gritti, one of the
"avvogadori di Commun," was at Mestre, some five miles from Venice, and,
happening to accost a servant of Jacopo's who was loading a barge with
wood, asked for the latest news from Venice, and got as answer, "Donato
has been murdered!" The possession of the news some hours before it had
been made public, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> fact that the newsmonger had been haunting
the purlieus of the Ducal Palace on the previous afternoon, enabled the
Ten to convict Jacopo. They alleged (Decree of X., March 26, 1451) that
other evidence ("<i>testificationes et scriptur&aelig;</i>") was in their
possession, and they pointed to the prisoner's obstinate silence on the
rack&mdash;a silence unbroken save by "several incantations and magic words
which fell from him," as a confirmation of his guilt. Moreover, it was
"for the advantage of the State from many points of view" that convicted
and condemned he should be. The question of his innocence or guilt
(complicated by the report or tradition that one Nicol&ograve; Erizzo confessed
on his death-bed that he had assassinated Donato for reasons of his own)
is still under discussion. Berlan (<i>I due Foscari</i>, etc., 1852, p. 36)
sums up against him. It may, however, be urged in favour of Jacopo that
the Ten did not produce or quote the <i>scriptur&aelig; et testificationes</i>
which convinced them of his guilt; that they stopped short of the
death-penalty, and pronounced a sentence inadequate to the crime; and,
lastly, that not many years before they had taken into consideration the
possibility and advisability of poisoning Filippo Visconti, an event
which would, no doubt, have been "to the advantage of the State from
many points of view."</p>

<p>Innocent or guilty, he was sentenced to perpetual banishment to the city
of Candia, on the north coast of the island of Crete; and, guilty or
innocent, Jacopo was not the man to make the best of what remained to
him and submit to fate. Intrigue he must, and, five years later (June,
1456), a report reached Venice that papers had been found in his
possession, some relating to the Duke of Milan, calculated to excite
"nuovi scandali e disordini," and others in cypher, which the Ten
could not read. Over and above these papers there was direct evidence
that Jacopo had written to the <i>Imperatore dei Turchi</i>, imploring him to
send his galley and take him away from Candia. Here was a fresh instance
of treachery to the Republic, and, July 21, 1456, Jacopo returned to
Venice under the custody of Lorenzo Loredano.</p>

<p>According to Romanin (<i>Storia, etc</i>., iv. 284), he was not put to the
torture, but confessed his guilt spontaneously, pleading, by way of
excuse, that the letter to the Duke of Milan had been allowed to fall
into the hands of spies, with a view to his being recalled to Venice and
obtaining a glimpse of his parents and family, even at a risk of a fresh
trial. On the other hand, the <i>Dolfin Cronaca</i>, the work of a kinsman of
the Foscari, which records Jacopo's fruitless appeal to the sorrowful
but inexorable Doge, and other incidents of a personal nature,
testifies, if not to torture on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> the rack, "to mutilation by thirty
strokes of the lash." Be that as it may, he was once more condemned to
lifelong exile, with the additional penalty that he should be imprisoned
for a year. He sailed for Venice July 31, 1456, and died at Candia,
January 12, 1457. Jacopo's misconduct and consequent misfortune
overshadowed the splendour of his father's reign, and, in very truth
"brought his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."</p>

<p>After his son's death, the aged Doge, now in his eighty-fifth year,
retired to his own apartments, and refused to preside at Councils of
State. The Ten, who in 1446 had yielded to the Doge's plea that a father
fretting for an exiled son could not discharge his public duties, were
instant that he should abdicate the dukedom on the score of decrepitude.
Accounts differ as to the mode in which he received the sentence of
deposition. It is certain that he was compelled to abdicate on Sunday
morning, October 23, 1457, but was allowed a breathing-space of a few
days to make his arrangements for quitting the Ducal Palace.</p>

<p>On Monday, October 24, the Great Council met to elect his successor, and
sat with closed doors till Sunday, October 30.</p>

<p>On Thursday, October 27, Francesco, heedless of a suggestion that he
should avoid the crowd, descended the Giants' Staircase for the last
time, and, says the <i>Dolfin Cronaca</i>, "after crossing the courtyard,
went out by the door leading to the prisons, and entered his boat by the
Ponte di Paglia." "He was dressed," says another chronicle (<i>August.
Cod.</i> I, cl. vii.), "in a scarlet mantle, from which the fur lining had
been taken," surmounted by a scarlet hood, an old friend which he had
worn when his ducal honours were new, and which he had entrusted to his
wife's care to be preserved for "red" days and festivals of State. "In
his hand he held his staff, as he walked very slowly. His brother Marco
was by his side, behind him were cousins and grandsons ... and in this
way he went to his own house."</p>

<p>On Sunday, October 30, Pasquale Malipiero was declared Doge, and two
days after, All Saints' Day, at the first hour of the morning, Francesco
Foscari died. If the interval between ten o'clock on Sunday night and
one o'clock on Tuesday morning disproves the legend that the discrowned
Doge ruptured a blood-vessel at the moment when the bell was tolling for
the election of his successor, the truth remains that, old as he was, he
died of a broken heart.</p>

<p>His predecessor, Tomaso Mocenigo, had prophesied on his death-bed that
if the Venetians were to make Foscari Doge they would forfeit their
"gold and silver, their honour and renown." "From your position of
lords," said he, "you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> will sink to that of vassals and servants to men
of arms." The prophecy was fulfilled. "If we look," writes Mr. H. F.
Brown (<i>Venice, etc.</i>, 1893, p. 306), "at the sum-total of Foscari's reign
... we find that the Republic had increased her land territory by the
addition of two great provinces, Bergamo and Brescia ... But the price
had been enormous ... her debt rose from 6,000,000 to 13,000,000 ducats.
Venetian funds fell to 18 &frac12;.... Externally there was much pomp and
splendour.... But underneath this bravery there lurked the official
corruption of the nobles, the suspicion of the Ten, the first signs of
bank failures, the increase in the national debt, the fall in the value
of the funds. Land wars and landed possessions drew the Venetians from
the sea to <i>terra ferma</i>.... The beginning of the end had arrived." (See
<i>Two Doges of Venice</i>, by Alethea Wiel, 1891; <i>I due Foscari, Memorie
Storicho Critiche</i>, di Francesco Berlan, 1852; <i>Storia Documentata di
Venezia</i>, di S. Romanin, 1855, vol.iv.; <i>Die beiden Foscari</i>, von
Richard Senger, 1878. For reviews, etc., of <i>The Two Foscari</i>,
<i>vide ante</i>,
"Introduction to <i>Sardanapalus</i>," <a href="#Page_5">p. 5</a>.)</p>

<p>Both Jeffrey in the <i>Edinburgh</i>, and Heber in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>,
took exception to the character of Jacopo Foscari, in accordance with
the Horatian maxim, "Incredulus odi." "If," said Jeffrey, "he had been
presented to the audience wearing out his heart in exile, ... we might
have caught some glimpse of the nature of his motives." As it is (in
obedience to the "unities") "we first meet with him led from the
'Question,' and afterwards ... clinging to the dungeon walls of his
native city, and expiring from his dread of leaving them." The situation
lacks conviction.</p>

<p>"If," argued Heber, "there ever existed in nature a case so
extraordinary as that of a man who gravely preferred tortures and a
dungeon at home, to a temporary residence in a beautiful island and a
fine climate; it is what few can be made to believe, and still fewer to
sympathize with."</p>

<p>It was, no doubt, with reference to these criticisms that Byron told
Medwin (<i>Conversations</i>, 1824, p. 173) that it was no invention of his
that the "young Foscari should have a sickly affection for his native
city.... I painted the men as I found them, as they were&mdash;not as the
critics would have them.... But no painting, however highly coloured,
can give an idea of the intensity of a Venetian's affection for his
native city."</p>

<p>Goethe, on the other hand, was "not careful" to note these
inconsistencies and perplexities. He thought that the dramatic handling
of <i>The Two Foscari</i> was "worthy of great praise," was "admirable!"
(<i>Conversations with Goethe</i>, 1874, p. 265).</p>

<p>The sigh of long imprisonment, the step</p>
<p>Of feet on which the iron clanked the groan</p>

<p>And yet for this I have returned to Venice,</p>
<p>With some faint hope, 'tis true, that Time, which wears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>For Venice but with such a yearning as</p>
<p>The dove has for her distant nest, when wheeling</p>

<p>Her callow brood. What letters are these which</p>

<p>His own and his belov&eacute;d's name. Alas!</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37" id="Footnote_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> [It is a moot point whether Jacopo Foscari was placed
on the rack on the occasion of his third trial. The original document of
the X. (July 23, 1456) runs thus: "Si videtur vobis per ea qu&aelig; dicta et
lecta sunt, quod <i>procedatur</i> contra Ser Jacobum Foscari;" and it is
argued (see F. Berlan, <i>I due Foscari, etc</i>., 1852, p. 57), (1) that the
word <i>procedatur</i> is not a euphemism for "tortured," but should be
rendered "judgment be given against;" (2) that if the X had decreed
torture, torture would have been expressly enjoined; and (3) that as the
decrees of the Council were not divulged, there was no motive for
ambiguity. S. Romanin (<i>Storia Documentata, etc</i>., 1853, iv. 284) and R.
Senger (<i>Die beiden Foscari</i>, 1878, p. 116) take the same view. On the
other hand, Miss A. Wiel (<i>Two Doges of Venice</i>, 1891, p. 107) points
out that, according to the <i>Dolfin Cronaca</i>, which Berlan did not
consult, Jacopo was in a "mutilated" condition when the trial was over,
and he was permitted to take a last farewell of his wife and children in
Torricella. Goethe (<i>Conversations</i>, 1874, pp. 264, 265) did not share
Eckermann's astonishment that Byron "could dwell so long on this
torturing subject." "He was always a self-tormentor, and hence such
subjects were his darling theme."]</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38" id="Footnote_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> <a id="Note_122"></a>{122}[It is extremely improbable that Francesco Foscari was
present in person at the third or two preceding trials of his son. As
may be gathered from the <i>parte</i> of the Council of Ten relating to the
first trial, there was a law which prescribed the contrary: "In ipsius
Domini Ducis pr&aelig;senti&acirc; de rebus ad ipsum, vel ad filios suos tangentibus
non tractetur, loquatur vel consulatur, sicut non potest (<i>fieri</i>)
quando tractatur de rebus tangentibus ad attinentes Domini Ducis." The
fact that "Nos Franciscus Foscari," etc., stood at the commencement of
the decree of exile may have given rise to the tradition that the Doge,
like a Roman father, tried and condemned his son. (See Berlan's <i>I due
Foscari</i>, p. 13.)]</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_39" id="Footnote_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> <a id="Note_123"></a>{123}[Pietro Loredano, admiral of the Venetian fleet, died
November 11, 1438. His death was sudden and suspicious, for he was taken
with violent pains and spasms after presiding at a banquet in honour of
his victories over the Milanese; and, when his illness ended fatally, it
was remembered that the Doge had publicly declared that so long as the
admiral lived he would never be <i>de facto</i> Prince of the Republic.
Jacopo Loredano chose to put his own interpretation on this outburst of
impatience, and inscribed on his father's monument in the Church of the
Monastery of Sant' Elena, in the Isola della Santa Lena, the words, "Per
insidias hostium veneno sublatus." (See <i>Ecclesi&aelig; Venet&aelig;</i>, by Flaminio
Cornaro, 1749, ix. 193, 194; see, too, Cicogna's <i>Inscrizioni
Veneziane</i>, 1830, iii. 381.)
</p><p>
Not long afterwards Marco Loredano, the admiral's brother, met with a
somewhat similar fate. He had been despatched by the X. to Legnano, to
investigate the conduct of Andrea Donate, the Doge's brother-in-law, who
was suspected of having embezzled the public moneys. His report was
unfavourable to Donato, and, shortly after, he too fell sick and died.
It is most improbable that the Doge was directly or indirectly
responsible for the death of either brother; but there was an hereditary
feud, and the libellous epitaph was a move in the game.]</p></div>

interview with his wife and family; and, secondly, the fact that there
were letters in cypher found in his possession, and that a direct
invitation to the Sultan to rescue him by force was among the impounded
documents ("Quod requirebat dictum Teucrum ut mitteret ex galeis suis ad

Italy, I perceive the expression of "Rome of the Ocean" applied to
Venice. The same phrase occurs in the "Two Foscari." My publisher can
vouch for me, that the tragedy was written and sent to England some time
before I had seen Lady Morgan's work, which I only received on the 16th
of August. I hasten, however, to notice the coincidence, and to yield
the originality of the phrase to her who first placed it before the
public.
</p><p>
[Byron calls Lady Morgan's <i>Italy</i> "fearless" on account of her
strictures on the behaviour of Great Britain to Genoa in 1814. "England
personally stood pledged to Genoa.... When the British officers rode
into their gates bearing the white flag consecrated by the holy word of
'<i>independence</i>,' the people ... '<i>kissed their garments</i>.'... Every
heart was open.... Lord William Bentinck's flag of '<i>Independenza</i>' was
taken down from the steeples and high places at sunrise; before noon the
arms of Sardinia blazoned in their stead; and yet the Genoese did not
rise <i>en masse</i> and massacre the English" (<i>Italy</i>, 1821, i. 245, 246).
The passage which Byron feared might be quoted to his disparagement runs
as follows: "As the bark glides on, as the shore recedes, and the city
of waves, the Rome of the ocean, rises on the horizon, the spirits
rally; ... and as the spires and cupolas of Venice come forth in the
lustre of the mid-day sun, and its palaces, half-veiled in the a&euml;rial
tints of distance, gradually assume their superb proportions, then the
dream of many a youthful vigil is realized" (<i>ibid</i>., ii. 449).]</p></div>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION_TO_CAIN" id="INTRODUCTION_TO_CAIN"></a>INTRODUCTION TO <i>CAIN</i>.
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>


<p><i><span class="smcap">Cain</span></i> was begun at Ravenna, July 16, and finished September 9, 1821
(<i>vide</i> MS. M.). Six months before, when he was at work on the first act
of <i>Sardanapalus</i>, Byron had "pondered" <i>Cain</i>, but it was not till
<i>Sardanapalus</i> and a second historical play, <i>The Two Foscari</i>, had been
written, copied out, and sent to England, that he indulged his genius
with a third drama&mdash;on "a metaphysical subject, something in the style
of <i>Manfred</i>" (<i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 189).</p>

<p>Goethe's comment on reading and reviewing <i>Cain</i> was that he should be
surprised if Byron did not pursue the treatment of such "biblical
subjects," as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<i>Conversations,
etc</i>., 1879, p. 62); and, many years after, he told Crabb Robinson
(<i>Diary</i>, 1869, ii. 435) that Byron should have lived "to execute his
vocation ... to dramatize the Old Testament." He was better equipped for
such a task than might have been imagined. A Scottish schoolboy, "from a
child he had known the Scriptures," and, as his <i>Hebrew Melodies</i>
testify, he was not unwilling to turn to the Bible as a source of poetic
inspiration. Moreover, he was born with the religious temperament.
Questions "of Providence, foreknowledge, will and fate," exercised his
curiosity because they appealed to his imagination and moved his spirit.
He was eager to plunge into controversy with friends and advisers who
challenged or rebuked him, Hodgson, for instance, or Dallas; and he
responded with remarkable amenity to the strictures and exhortations of
such orthodox professors as Mr. Sheppard and Dr. Kennedy. He was, no
doubt, from first to last a <i>heretic</i>, impatient, not to say
contemptuous, of authority, but he was by no means indifferent to
religion altogether. To "argue about it and about" was a necessity, if
not an agreeable relief, to his intellectual energies. It would appear
from the Ravenna diary (January 28, 1821, <i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 190,191),
that the conception of Lucifer was working in his brain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span> before the
"tragedy of Cain" was actually begun. He had been recording a "thought"
which had come to him, that "at the very height of human desire and
pleasure, a certain sense of doubt and sorrow"&mdash;an <i>amari aliquid</i> which
links the future to the past, and so blots out the present&mdash;"mingles
with our bliss," making it of none effect, and, by way of moral or
corollary to his soliloquy, he adds three lines of verse headed,
"Thought for a speech of Lucifer in the Tragedy of <i>Cain</i>"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Were Death an <i>Evil</i>, would <i>I</i> let thee live?</p>
<p>Fool! live as I live&mdash;as thy father lives,</p>
<p>And thy son's sons shall live for evermore."</p>
</div></div>

<p>In these three lines, which were not inserted in the play, and in the
preceding "thought," we have the key-note to <i>Cain</i>. "Man walketh in a
vain shadow"&mdash;a shadow which he can never overtake, the shadow of an
eternally postponed fruition. With a being capable of infinite
satisfaction, he is doomed to realize failure in attainment. In all that
is best and most enjoyable, "the rapturous moment and the placid hour,"
there is a foretaste of "Death the Unknown"! The tragedy of <i>Manfred</i>
lies in remorse for the inevitable past; the tragedy of <i>Cain</i>, in
revolt against the limitations of the inexorable present.</p>

<p>The investigation of the "sources" of <i>Cain</i> does not lead to any very
definite conclusion (see <i>Lord Byron's Cain und Seine Quellen</i>, von
Alfred Schaffner, 1880). He was pleased to call his play "a Mystery,"
and, in his Preface (<i>vide post</i>, <a href="#Page_207">p. 207</a>), Byron alludes to the Old
Mysteries as "those very profane productions, whether in English,
French, Italian, or Spanish." The first reprint of the <i>Chester Plays</i>
was published by the Roxburghe Club in 1818, but Byron's knowledge of
Mystery Plays was probably derived from <i>Dodsley's Plays</i> (ed. 1780, l.,
xxxiii.-xlii.), or from John Stevens's Continuation of Dugdale's
<i>Monasticon</i> (<i>vide post</i>, <a href="#Page_207">p. 207</a>), or possibly, as Herr Schaffner
suggests, from Warton's <i>History of English Poetry</i>, ed. 1871, ii.
222-230. He may, too, have witnessed some belated <i>Rappresentazione</i> of
the Creation and Fall at Ravenna, or in one of the remoter towns or
villages of Italy. There is a superficial resemblance between the
treatment of the actual encounter of Cain and Abel, and the conventional
rendering of the same incident in the <i>Ludus Coventri&aelig;</i>, and in the
<i>Mist&egrave;re du Viel Testament</i>; but it is unlikely that he had closely
studied any one Mystery Play at first hand. On the other hand, his
recollections of Gessner's <i>Death of Abel</i> which "he had never read
since he was eight years old," were clearer than he imagined. Not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span> only
in such minor matters as the destruction of Cain's altar by a whirlwind,
and the substitution of the Angel of the Lord for the <i>Deus</i> of the
Mysteries, but in the Teutonic domesticities of Cain and Adah, and the
evangelical piety of Adam and Abel, there is a reflection, if not an
imitation, of the German idyll (see Gessner's <i>Death of Abel</i>, ed. 1797,
pp. 80, 102).</p>

<p>Of his indebtedness to Milton he makes no formal acknowledgment, but he
was not ashamed to shelter himself behind Milton's shield when he was
attacked on the score of blasphemy and profanity. "If <i>Cain</i> be
blasphemous, <i>Paradise Lost</i> is blasphemous" (letter to Murray, Pisa,
February 8, 1822), was, he would fain believe, a conclusive answer to
his accusers. But apart from verbal parallels or coincidences, there is
a genuine affinity between Byron's Lucifer and Milton's Satan. Lucifer,
like Satan, is "not less than Archangel ruined," a repulsed but
"unvanquished Titan," marred by a demonic sorrow, a confessor though a
rival of Omnipotence. He is a majestic and, as a rule, a serious and
solemn spirit, who compels the admiration and possibly the sympathy of
the reader. There is, however, another strain in his ghostly attributes,
which betrays a more recent consanguinity: now and again he gives token
that he is of the lineage of Mephistopheles. He is sometimes, though
rarely, a mocking as well as a rebellious spirit, and occasionally
indulges in a grim <i>persiflage</i> beneath the dignity if not the capacity
of Satan. It is needless to add that Lucifer has a most lifelike
personality of his own. The conception of the spirit of evil justifying
an eternal antagonism to the Creator from the standpoint of a superior
morality, may, perhaps, be traced to a Manichean source, but it has been
touched with a new emotion. Milton's devil is an abstraction of infernal
pride&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">"Sole Positive of Night!</p>
<p class="i8">Antipathist of Light!</p>
<p>Fate's only essence! primal scorpion rod&mdash;</p>
<p>The one permitted opposite of God!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>Goethe's devil is an abstraction of scorn. He "maketh a mock" alike of
good and evil! But Byron's devil is a spirit, yet a mortal too&mdash;the
traducer, because he has suffered for his sins; the deceiver, because he
is self-deceived; the hoper against hope that there is a ransom for the
soul in perfect self-will and not in perfect self-sacrifice. Byron did
not uphold Lucifer, but he "had passed that way," and could imagine a
spiritual warfare not only against the <i>Deus</i> of the Mysteries or of the
Book of Genesis, but against what he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span> believed and acknowledged to be
the Author and Principle of good.</p>

<p><i>Autres temps, autres m&#339;urs!</i> It is all but impossible for the modern
reader to appreciate the audacity of <i>Cain</i>, or to realize the alarm and
indignation which it aroused by its appearance. Byron knew that he was
raising a tempest, and pleads, in his Preface, "that with regard to the
language of Lucifer, it was difficult for me to make him talk like a
clergyman," and again and again he assures his correspondents (<i>e.g.</i> to
Murray, November 23, 1821, "<i>Cain</i> is nothing more than a drama;" to
Moore, March 4, 1822, "With respect to Religion, can I never convince
you that <i>I</i> have no such opinions as the characters in that drama,
which seems to have frightened everybody?" <i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 469; vi.
30) that it is Lucifer and not Byron who puts such awkward questions
with regard to the "politics of paradise" and the origin of evil. Nobody
seems to have believed him. It was taken for granted that Lucifer was
the mouthpiece of Byron, that the author of <i>Don Juan</i> was not "on the
side of the angels."</p>

<p>Little need be said of the "literature," the pamphlets and poems which
were evoked by the publication of <i>Cain: A Mystery</i>. One of the most
prominent assailants (said to be the Rev. H. J. Todd (1763-1845),
Archdeacon of Cleveland, 1832, author <i>inter alia</i> of <i>Original Sin</i>,
<i>Free Will</i>, etc., 1818) issued <i>A Remonstrance to Mr. John Murray,
respecting a Recent Publication</i>, 1822, signed "Oxoniensis." The sting
of the <i>Remonstrance</i> lay in the exposure of the fact that Byron was
indebted to Bayle's <i>Dictionary</i> for his rabbinical legends, and that he
had derived from the same source his Manichean doctrines of the <i>Two
Principles, etc.</i>, and other "often-refuted sophisms" with regard to the
origin of evil. Byron does not borrow more than a poet and a gentleman
is at liberty to acquire by way of raw material, but it cannot be denied
that he had read and inwardly digested more than one of Bayle's "most
objectionable articles" (<i>e.g.</i> "Adam," "Eve," "Abel," "Manichees,"
"Paulicians," etc.). The <i>Remonstrance</i> was answered in <i>A Letter to Sir
Walter Scott, etc.</i>, by "Harroviensis." Byron welcomed such a "Defender
of the Faith," and was anxious that Murray should print the letter
together with the poem. But Murray belittled the "defender," and was
upbraided in turn for his slowness of heart (letter to Murray, June 6,
1822, <i>Letters</i>, 1901, vi. 76).</p>

<p>Fresh combatants rushed into the fray: "Philo-Milton," with a
<i>Vindication of the "Paradise Lost" from the charge of exculpating
"Cain: A Mystery</i>," London, 1822; "Britannicus," with a pamphlet
entitled, <i>Revolutionary Causes, etc., and A Postscript containing
Strictures on "Cain," etc.</i>, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>London, 1822, etc.; but their works, which
hardly deserve to be catalogued, have perished with them. Finally, in
1830, a barrister named Harding Grant, author of <i>Chancery Practice</i>,
compiled a work (<i>Lord Byron's "Cain," etc., with Notes</i>) of more than
four hundred pages, in which he treats "the proceedings and speeches of
Lucifer with the same earnestness as if they were existing and earthly
personages." But it was "a week too late." The "Coryph&aelig;us of the
Satanic School" had passed away, and the tumult had "dwindled to a
calm."</p>

<p><i>Cain</i> "appeared in conjunction with" <i>Sardanapalus</i> and <i>The Two
Foscari</i>, December 19, 1821. Last but not least of the three plays, it
had been announced "by a separate advertisement (<i>Morning Chronicle</i>,
November 24, 1821), for the purpose of exciting the greater curiosity"
(<i>Memoirs of the Life, etc.</i> [by John Watkins], 1822, p. 383), and it
was no sooner published than it was pirated. In the following January,
"<i>Cain: A Mystery</i>, by the author of <i>Don Juan</i>," was issued by W.
Benbow, at Castle Street, Leicester Square (the notorious "Byron Head,"
which Southey described as "one of those preparatory schools for the
brothel and the gallows, where obscenity, sedition, and blasphemy are
retailed in drams for the vulgar"!).</p>

<p>Murray had paid Byron &pound;2710 for the three tragedies, and in order to
protect the copyright, he applied, through counsel (Lancelot Shadwell,
afterwards Vice-Chancellor), for an injunction in Chancery to stop the
sale of piratical editions of <i>Cain</i>. In delivering judgment (February
12, 1822), the Chancellor, Lord Eldon (see <i>Courier</i>, Wednesday,
February 13), replying to Shadwell, drew a comparison between <i>Cain</i> and
<i>Paradise Lost</i>, "which he had read from beginning to end during the
course of the last Long Vacation&mdash;<i>solicit&aelig; jucunda oblivia vit&aelig;</i>." No
one, he argued, could deny that the object and effects of <i>Paradise
Lost</i> were "not to bring into disrepute," but "to promote reverence for
our religion," and, <i>per contra</i>, no one could affirm that it was
impossible to arrive at an opposite conclusion with regard to "the
Preface, the poem, the general tone and manner of <i>Cain</i>." It was a
question for a jury. A jury might decide that <i>Cain</i> was blasphemous,
and void of copyright; and as there was a reasonable doubt in his mind
as to the character of the book, and a doubt as to the conclusion at
which a jury would arrive, he was compelled to refuse the injunction.
According to Dr. Smiles (<i>Memoir of John Murray</i>, 1891, i. 428), the
decision of a jury was taken, and an injunction eventually granted. If
so, it was ineffectual, for Benbow issued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span> another edition of <i>Cain</i> in
1824 (see Jacob's <i>Reports</i>, p. 474, note). See, too, the case of
Murray <i>v</i>. Benbow and Another, as reported in the <i>Examiner</i>, February
17, 1822; and cases of Wolcot <i>v</i>. Walker, Southey <i>v</i>. Sherwood, Murray
<i>v</i>. Benbow, and Lawrence <i>v</i>. Smith [<i>Quarterly Review</i>, April, 1822,
vol. xxvii. pp. 120-138].</p>

<p>"<i>Cain</i>," said Moore (February 9, 1822), "has made a sensation." Friends
and champions, the press, the public "turned up their thumbs." Gifford
shook his head; Hobhouse "launched out into a most violent invective"
(letter to Murray, November 24, 1821); Jeffrey, in the <i>Edinburgh</i>, was
regretful and hortatory; Heber, in the <i>Quarterly</i>, was fault-finding
and contemptuous. The "parsons preached at it from Kentish Town to Pisa"
(letter to Moore, February 20, 1822). Even "the very highest authority
in the land," his Majesty King George IV., "expressed his disapprobation
of the blasphemy and licentiousness of Lord Byron's writings"
(<i>Examiner</i>, February 17, 1822). Byron himself was forced to admit that
"my Mont Saint Jean seems Cain" (<i>Don Juan</i>, Canto XI. stanza lvi. line
2). The many were unanimous in their verdict, but the higher court of
the few reversed the judgment.</p>

<p>Goethe said that "Its beauty is such as we shall not see a second time
in the world" (<i>Conversations, etc.</i>, 1874, p. 261); Scott, in speaking
of "the very grand and tremendous drama of <i>Cain</i>," said that the author
had "matched Milton on his own ground" (letter to Murray, December 4,
1821, <i>vide post</i>, p. 206); "<i>Cain</i>," wrote Shelley to Gisborne (April
10, 1822), "is apocalyptic; it is a revelation never before communicated
to man."</p>

<p>Uncritical praise, as well as uncritical censure, belongs to the past;
but the play remains, a singular exercise of "poetic energy," a
confession, <i>ex animo</i>, of "the burthen of the mystery, ... the heavy
and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world."</p>

<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following scenes are entitled "A Mystery," in conformity with the
ancient title annexed to dramas upon similar subjects, which were styled
"Mysteries, or Moralities."<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The author has by no means taken the
same liberties with his subject which were common formerly, as may be
seen by any reader curious enough to refer to those very profane
productions, whether in English, French, Italian, or Spanish. The author
has endeavoured to preserve the language adapted to his characters; and
where it is (and this is but rarely) taken from actual <i>Scripture</i>, he
has made as little alteration, even of words, as the rhythm would
permit. The reader will recollect that the book of Genesis does not
state<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span> that Eve was tempted by a demon, but by "the Serpent<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>;" and
that only because he was "the most subtil of all the beasts of the
field." Whatever interpretation the Rabbins and the Fathers may have put
upon this, I take the words as I find them, and reply, with Bishop
Watson<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> upon similar occasions, when the Fathers were quoted to him
as Moderator in the schools of Cambridge, "Behold the Book!"&mdash;holding up
the Scripture. It is to be recollected, that my present subject has
nothing to do with the <i>New Testament</i>, to which no reference can be
here made without anachronism.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> With the poems upon similar topics I
have not been recently familiar. Since I was twenty I have never read
Milton; but I had read him so frequently before, that this may make
little difference. Gesner's "Death of Abel" I have never read since I
was eight years of age, at Aberdeen. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span> general impression of my
recollection is delight; but of the contents I remember only that Cain's
wife was called Mahala, and Abel's Thirza; in the following pages I have
called them "Adah" and "Zillah," the earliest female names which occur
in Genesis. They were those of Lamech's wives: those of Cain and Abel
are not called by their names. Whether, then, a coincidence of subject
may have caused the same in expression, I know nothing, and care as
little. [I<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> am prepared to be accused of Manicheism,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> or some
other hard name ending in <i>ism</i>, which makes a formidable figure and
awful sound in the eyes and ears of those who would be as much puzzled
to explain the terms so bandied about, as the liberal and pious
indulgers in such epithets. Against such I can defend myself, or, if
necessary, I can attack in turn. "Claw for claw, as Conan said to Satan
and the deevil take the shortest nails" (Waverley).<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>]</p>

<p>The reader will please to bear in mind (what few choose to recollect),
that there is no allusion to a future state in any of the books of
Moses, nor indeed in the Old Testament. For a reason for this
extraordinary omission he may consult Warburton's "Divine
Legation;"<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span> whether satisfactory or not, no better has yet been
assigned. I have therefore supposed it new to Cain, without, I hope, any
perversion of Holy Writ.</p>

<p>With regard to the language of Lucifer, it was difficult for me to make
him talk like a clergyman upon the same subjects; but I have done what I
could to restrain him within the bounds of spiritual politeness. If he
disclaims having tempted Eve in the shape of the Serpent, it is only
because the book of Genesis has not the most distant allusion to
anything of the kind, but merely to the Serpent in his serpentine
capacity.</p>

<p><i>Note</i>.&mdash;The reader will perceive that the author has partly adopted in
this poem the notion of Cuvier,<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> that the world had been destroyed
several times before the creation of man. This speculation, derived from
the different strata and the bones of enormous and unknown animals found
in them, is not contrary to the Mosaic account, but rather confirms it;
as no human bones have yet been discovered in those strata, although
those of many known animals are found near the remains of the unknown.
The assertion of Lucifer, that the pre-Adamite world was also peopled by
rational beings much more intelligent than man, and proportionably
powerful to the mammoth, etc., etc., is, of course, a poetical fiction
to help him to make out his case.</p>

<p>I ought to add, that there is a "tramelogedia" of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> Alfieri, called
"Abele."<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> I have never read that, nor any other of the posthumous

<a id="Note_205"></a>{205}[On the 13th December [1821] Sir Walter received a
copy of Cain, as yet unpublished, from Murray, who had been instructed
to ask whether he had any objection to having the "Mystery" dedicated to
him. He replied in these words&mdash;

"Edinburgh, <i>4th December</i>, 1821.
</p><p>
"My Dear Sir,&mdash;I accept, with feelings of great obligation, the
flattering proposal of Lord Byron to prefix my name to the very grand
and tremendous drama of 'Cain.'<a href="#inner_A">[*]</a> I may be partial to it, and you will
allow I have cause; but I do not know that his Muse has ever taken so
lofty a flight amid her former soarings. He has certainly matched Milton
on his own ground. Some part of the language is bold, and may shock one
class of readers, whose line will be adopted by others out of
affectation or envy. But then they must condemn the 'Paradise Lost,' if
they have a mind to be consistent. The fiend-like reasoning and bold
blasphemy of the fiend and of his pupil lead exactly to the point which
was to be expected,&mdash;the commission of the first murder, and the ruin
and despair of the perpetrator.
</p><p>
"I do not see how any one can accuse the author himself of Manicheism.
The Devil talks the language of that sect, doubtless; because, not being
able to deny the existence of the Good Principle, he endeavours to exalt
himself&mdash;the Evil Principle&mdash;to a seeming equality with the Good; but
such arguments, in the mouth of such a being, can only be used to
deceive and to betray. Lord Byron might have made this more evident, by
placing in the mouth of Adam, or of some good and protecting spirit, the
reasons which render the existence of moral evil consistent with the
general benevolence of the Deity. The great key to the mystery is,
perhaps, the imperfection of our own faculties, which see and feel
strongly the partial evils which press upon us, but know too little of
the general system of the universe, to be aware how the existence of
these is to be reconciled with the benevolence of the great Creator.
</p><p>
"To drop these speculations, you have much occasion for some mighty
spirit, like Lord Byron, to come down and trouble the waters; for,
excepting 'The John Bull,'<a href="#inner_B">[**]</a> you seem stagnating strangely in London.

[<a id="inner_A" name="inner_A"></a>[*] "However, the praise often given to Byron has been so exaggerated
as to provoke, perhaps, a reaction in which he is unduly disparaged. 'As
various in composition as Shakespeare himself, Lord Byron has embraced,'
says Sir Walter Scott, 'every topic of human life, and sounded every
string on the divine harp, from its slightest to its most powerful and
heart-astounding tones.... In the very grand and tremendous drama of
Cain,' etc.... 'And Lord Byron has done all this,' Scott adds, 'while
managing his pen with the careless and negligent ease of a man of
quality.'"&mdash;<i>Poetry of Byron, chosen and arranged by Matthew Arnold</i>,
1881, p. xiii.
</p><p>
Scott does not add anything of the kind. The comparison with Shakespeare
was written after Byron's death in May, 1824; the appreciation of Cain
in December, 1821 (<i>vide supra</i>); while the allusion to "a man of
quality" is to be found in an article contributed to the <i>Quarterly
Review</i> in 1816!]

[<a id="inner_B" name="inner_B"></a>[**] The first number of <i>John Bull</i>, "For God, the King, and the
People," was published Sunday, December 17, 1820. Theodore Hook was the
editor, and it is supposed that he owed his appointment to the
intervention of Sir Walter Scott. The <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of <i>John Bull</i> was
to write up George IV., and to write down Queen Caroline. "The national
movement (in favour of the Queen) was arrested; and George IV. had
mainly <i>John Bull</i> to thank for that result."&mdash;<i>A Sketch</i>, [by J. G.
Lockhart], 1852, p. 45.] ]</p></div>

distinct from "Moralities." Byron seems to have had some acquaintance
with the arch&aelig;ology of the drama, but it is not easy to divine the
source or extent of his knowledge. He may have received and read the
Roxburghe reprint of the <i>Chester Plays</i>, published in 1818; but it is
most probable that he had read the pages devoted to mystery plays in
<i>Warton's History of Poetry</i>, or that he had met with a version of the
<i>Ludus Coventri&aelig;</i> (reprinted by J. O. Halliwell Phillipps, in 1841),
printed in Stevens's continuation of Dugdale's <i>Monasticon</i>, 1722, i.
139-153. There is a sixteenth-century edition of <i>Le Mist&egrave;re du Viel
Testament</i>, which was reprinted by the Baron James de Rothschild, in
1878 (see for "De la Mort d'Abel et de la Malediction Cayn," pp.
103-113); but it is improbable that it had come under Byron's notice.

appointed Moderator of the Schools in 1762, and Regius Professor of
Divinity October 31, 1771. According to his own story (<i>Anecdotes of the
Life of Richard Watson</i>, 1817, p. 39), "I determined to study nothing
but my Bible.... I had no prejudice against, no predilection for, the
Church of England, but a sincere regard for the <i>Church of Christ</i>, and
an insuperable objection to every degree of dogmatical intolerance. I
never troubled myself with answering any arguments which the opponents
in the Divinity Schools brought against the articles of the Church, ...
but I used on such occasions to say to them, holding the New Testament
in my hand, '<i>En sacrum codicem</i>! Here is the foundation of truth! Why
do you follow the streams derived from it by the sophistry, or polluted
by the passions, of man?'" It may be conceived that Watson's appeal to
"Scripture" was against the sentence of orthodoxy. His authority as "a
school Divine" is on a par with that of the author of <i>Cain</i>, or of an
earlier theologian who "quoted Genesis like a very learned clerk"!]</p></div>

Darkness who made the body, and a God of Light who was responsible for

rescue the soul, the spiritual part of man, from the possession and
grasp of the body, which had been created by and was in the possession
of the spirit of evil. St. Augustine passed through a stage of
Manicheism, and in after-life exposed and refuted the heretical tenets
which he had advocated, and with which he was familiar. See, for
instance, his account of the Manich&aelig;an heresy "de duplici terr&acirc;, de

INTRODUCTION TO <i>HEAVEN AND EARTH.</i>
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>


<p><i><span class="smcap">Heaven</span> and Earth</i> was begun at Ravenna October 9,1821. "It occupied
about fourteen days" (Medwin's <i>Conversations</i>, 1824, p. 231), and was
forwarded to Murray, November 9, 1821. "You will find <i>it</i>," wrote Byron
(<i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 474), "<i>pious</i> enough, I trust&mdash;at least some of
the Chorus might have been written by Sternhold and Hopkins themselves
for that, and perhaps for the melody." It was on "a scriptural
subject"&mdash;"less speculative than <i>Cain</i>, and very pious" (<i>Letters</i>,
1901, v. 475; vi. 31). It was to be published, he insists, at the same
time, and, if possible, in the same volume with the "others"
(<i>Sardanapalus</i>, etc.), and would serve, so he seems to have <i>reflected</i>
("The moment he reflects, he is a child," said Goethe), as an antidote
to the audacities, or, as some would have it, the impieties of <i>Cain</i>!</p>

<p>He reckoned without his publisher, who understood the temper of the
public and of the Government, and was naturally loth to awaken any more
"reasonable doubts" in the mind of the Chancellor with regard to whether
a "scriptural drama" was irreverent or profane. The new "Mystery" was
revised by Gifford and printed, but withheld from month to month, till,
at length, "the fire kindled," and, on the last day of October, 1821,
Byron instructed John Hunt to "obtain from Mr. Murray <i>Werner: a Drama</i>,
and another dramatic poem called <i>Heaven and Earth</i>." It was published
in the second number of <i>The Liberal</i> (pp. 165-206), January 1, 1823.</p>

<p>The same subject, the unequal union of angelic lovers with the daughters
of men, had taken Moore's fancy a year before Byron had begun to
"dramatize the Old Testament." He had designed a long poem, but having
discovered that Byron was at work on the same theme, he resolved to
restrict himself to the production of an "episode," to "give himself the
chance of ... an <i>heliacal rising</i>," before he was outshone by the
advent of a greater luminary. Thanks to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span> Murray's scruples, and the
"translation" of MSS. to Hunt, the "episode" took the lead of the
"Mystery" by eight days. The <i>Loves of the Angels</i> (see <i>Memoirs</i>, etc.,
1853, iv. 28) was published December 23, 1822. None the less, lyric and
drama were destined to run in double harness. Critics found it
convenient to review the two poems in the same article, and were at
pains to draw a series of more or less pointed and pungent comparisons
between the unwilling though not unwitting rivals.</p>

<p>Wilson, in <i>Blackwood</i>, writes, "The first [the <i>Loves, etc.</i>] is all
glitter and point like a piece of Derbyshire spar, and the other is dark
and massy like a block of marble.... Moore writes with a crow-quill, ...
Byron writes with an eagle's plume;" while Jeffrey, in the <i>Edinburgh</i>,
likens Moore to "an <i>aurora borealis</i>" and Byron to "an eruption of
Mount Vesuvius"!</p>

<p>There is, indeed, apart from the subject, nothing in common between
Moore's tender and alluring lyric and Byron's gloomy and tumultuous
rhapsody, while contrast is to be sought rather in the poets than in
their poems. The <i>Loves of the Angels</i> is the finished composition of an
accomplished designer of Amoretti, one of the best of his kind, <i>Heaven
and Earth</i> is the rough and unpromising sketch thrown off by a great
master.</p>

<p>Both the one and the other have passed out of the ken of readers of
poetry, but, on the whole, the <i>Loves of the Angels</i> has suffered the
greater injustice. It is opined that there may be possibilities in a
half-forgotten work of Byron, but it is taken for granted that nothing
worthy of attention is to be found in Moore. At the time, however, Moore
scored a success, and Byron hardly escaped a failure. It is to be noted
that within a month of publication (January 18, 1823) Moore was at work
upon a revise for a fifth edition&mdash;consulting D'Herbelot "for the
project of turning the poor 'Angels' into Turks," and so "getting rid of
that connection with the Scriptures," which, so the Longmans feared,
would "in the long run be a drag on the popularity of the poem"
(<i>Memoirs, etc.</i>, 1853, iv. 41). It was no wonder that Murray was
"timorous" with regard to Byron and his "scriptural dramas," when the
Longmans started at the shadow of a scriptural allusion.</p>

<p>Byron, in his innocence, had taken for his motto the verse in <i>Genesis</i>
(ch. vi. 2), which records the intermarriage of the "sons of God" with
the "daughters of men." In <i>Heaven and Earth</i> the angels <i>are</i> angels,
members, though erring members, of Jehovah's "thundering choir," and the
daughters of men are the descendants of Cain. The question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span> had come up
for debate owing to the recent appearance of a translation of the <i>Book
of Enoch</i> (by Richard Laurence, LL.D., Oxford, 1821); and Moore, by way
of safeguarding himself against any suspicion of theological
irregularity, is careful to assure his readers ("Preface" to <i>Loves of
the Angels</i>, 1823, p. viii. and note, pp. 125-127) that the "sons of
God" were the descendants of Seth, and not beings of a supernatural
order, as a mis-translation by the LXX., assisted by Philo and the
"rhapsodical fictions of the <i>Book of Enoch</i>" had induced the ignorant
or the profane to suppose. Nothing is so dangerous as innocence, and a
little more of that <i>empeiria</i> of which Goethe accused him, would have
saved Byron from straying from the path of orthodoxy.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say for certain whether Laurence's translation of
the whole of the <i>Book of Enoch</i> had come under Byron's notice before he
planned his new "Mystery," but it is plain that he was, at any rate,
familiar with the well-known fragment, "Concerning the 'Watchers'"
[<span title="Peri\ t&ocirc;n E)gr&ecirc;go/r&ocirc;n">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054;
&#964;&#969;&#957; &#7960;&#947;&#961;&#951;&#947;&#8057;&#961;&#969;&#957;</span>], which is
preserved in the <i>Chronographia</i> of Georgius Syncellus, and was first
printed by J. J. Scaliger in <i>Thes. temp. Euseb.</i> in 1606. In the
prophecy of the Deluge to which he alludes (<i>vide post</i>, <a href="#Note_302">p. 302, note 1</a>),
the names of the delinquent seraphs (Semj&acirc;z&acirc; and Az&acirc;z&ecirc;l), and of the
archangelic monitor Raphael, are to be found in the fragment. The germ
of <i>Heaven and Earth</i> is not in the <i>Book of Genesis</i>, but in the <i>Book
of Enoch</i>.</p>

<p>Medwin, who prints (<i>Conversations</i>, 1824, pp. 234-238) what purports to
be the prose sketch of a Second Part of <i>Heaven and Earth</i> (he says that
Byron compared it to Coleridge's promised conclusion of
<i>Christabel</i>&mdash;"that, and nothing more!"), detects two other strains in
the composition of the "Mystery," an echo of Goethe's Faust and a
"movement" which recalls the <i>Eumenides</i> of &AElig;schylus. Byron told Murray
that his fourth tragedy was "more lyrical and Greek" than he at first
intended, and there is no doubt that with the <i>Prometheus Vinctus</i> he
was familiar, if not at first hand, at least through the medium of
Shelley's rendering. But apart from the "Greek choruses," which "Shelley
made such a fuss about," Byron was acquainted with, and was not
untouched by, the metrical peculiarities of the <i>Curse of Kehama</i>, and
might have traced a kinship between his "angels" and Southey's
"Glendoveers," to say nothing of <i>their</i> collaterals, the "glumms" and
"gawreys" of <i>Peter Wilkins</i> (see notes to Southey's <i>Curse of Kehama</i>,
Canto VI., <i>Poetical Works</i>, 1838, viii. 231-233).</p>

<p>Goethe was interested in <i>Heaven and Earth.</i> "He preferred it," says
Crabb Robinson (<i>Diary</i>, 1869, ii. 434),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span> "to all the other serious
poems of Byron.... 'A bishop,' he exclaimed, though it sounded almost
like satire, 'might have written it.' Goethe must have been thinking of
a <i>German</i> bishop!" (For his daughter-in-law's translation of the
speeches of Anah and Aholibamah with their seraph-lovers, see
<i>Goethe-Jahrbuch</i>, 1899, pp. 18-21 [Letters, 1901, v. Appendix II. p.
518].)</p>

<p><i>Heaven and Earth</i> was reviewed by Jeffrey in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
February, 1823, vol. 38, pp. 42-48; by Wilson in <i>Blackwood's Edinburgh
Magazine</i>, January, 1823, vol. xiii. pp. 71, 72; and in the <i>New Monthly
Magazine</i>, N.S., 1823, vol. 7, pp. 353-358.</p>

[Some fragments of the <i>Book of Enoch</i> (<i>vide ante</i>, Introduction to
<i>Heaven and Earth</i>, <a href="#Page_281">p. 281</a>), which were included by Georgius Syncellus
(a Byzantine writer of the eighth century A.D.) in his <i>Chronographia</i>,
pp. ii, 26 (<i>Corpus Script. Hist. Byzantint&aelig;</i>, 1829, i. 20), were
printed by J. J. Scaliger in 1606. They were, afterwards, included (i.
347-354) in the <i>Spicilegium SS. Patrum</i> of Joannes Ernestus Grabius,
which was published at Oxford in 1714. A year after (1715) one of the
fragments was "made English," and published under the title of <i>The
History of the Angels and their Gallantry with the Daughters of Men</i>,
written by Enoch the Patriarch.
</p><p>
In 1785 James Bruce, the traveller, discovered three MSS. of the <i>Book
of Enoch</i>. One he conveyed to the library at Paris: a second MS. he
presented to the Bodleian Library at Oxford (<i>Travels</i>, ii. 422, 8vo ed.
1805). In 1801 an article entitled, "Notice du Libre d'Enoch," was
contributed by Silvestre de Sacy to the <i>Magasin Encyclop&eacute;dique</i> (An.
vi. tom. i. p. 369); and in 1821 Richard Laurence, LL.D., published a
translation "from the Ethiopic MS. in the Bodleian Library." This was
the first translation of the book as a whole.
</p><p>
The following extracts, which were evidently within Byron's recollection
when he planned <i>Heaven and Earth</i>, are taken from <i>The Book of Enoch</i>,
translated from Professor Dillman's Ethiopic Text, by R. H. Charles,
Oxford, 1892:&mdash;
</p><p>
"Chap. vi. [1. And it came to pass when the children of men had
multiplied in those days that beautiful and comely daughters were born
unto them. [2. And the angels, the sons of the Heavens, saw and lusted
after them, and spake one to another, 'Come now, let us choose us wives
from among the children of men, and beget children.' [3. And Semj&acirc;z&acirc;,
who was the leader, spake unto them: I fear ye will not indeed agree to
do this deed.... [6. And they descended in the days of Jared on the
summit of Mount Hermon....

"Chap. viii. [i. And Az&acirc;z&ecirc;l taught men to make swords, etc.
</p><p>
"Chap. x.
Then spake the Most High, the Great, the Holy One, and sent Arsjal&acirc;lj&ucirc;r

whole earth will be destroyed, and a deluge will presently cover up the
whole earth, and all that is in it will be destroyed. [3. And now
instruct him that he may escape, as his seed may be preserved for all
generations. [4. And again the Lord spake to Rafael; Bind Az&acirc;z&ecirc;l hand
and foot, and place him in darkness; make an opening in the desert which

"Azazael and Samiasa ... rise into the air with the two sisters.... The
appearance of the land strangled by the ocean will serve by way of
scenery and decorations. The affectionate tenderness of Adah for those
from whom she is parted, and for ever, and her fears contrasting with
the loftier spirit of Aholibamah triumphing in the hopes of a new and
greater destiny will make the dialogue. They, in the meantime, continue
their a&euml;rial voyage, everywhere denied admittance in those floating
islands over the sea of space, and driven back by guardian-spirits of
the different planets, till they are at length forced to alight on the
only peak of the earth uncovered by water. Here a parting takes place
between the lovers.... The fallen angels are suddenly called, and
condemned, their destination and punishment unknown. The sisters cling
to the rock, the waters mounting higher and higher. Now enter Ark. The
scene draws up, and discovers Japhet endeavouring to persuade the
Patriarch, with very strong arguments of love and pity, to receive the
sisters, or at least Adah, on board. Adah joins in his entreaties, and
endeavours to cling to the sides of the vessel. The proud and haughty
Aholibamah scorns to pray either to God or man, and anticipates the
grave by plunging into the waters. Noah is still inexorable. [Adah] is
momentarily in danger of perishing before the eyes of the Arkites.
Japhet is in despair. The last wave sweeps her from the rock, and her
lifeless corpse floats past in all its beauty, whilst a sea-bird screams
over it, and seems to be the spirit of her angel lord. I once thought of
conveying the lovers to the moon or one of the planets; but it is not
easy for the imagination to make any unknown world more beautiful than
this; besides, I did not think they would approve of the moon as a
residence. I remember what Fontenelle said of its having no atmosphere,
and the dark spots having caverns where the inhabitants reside. There
was another objection: all the human interest would have been destroyed,
which I have even endeavoured to give my angels."]

Wallack as "Ulric," Mrs. Faucit as "Josephine," and Miss Mordaunt as
"Ida." According to the <i>Times</i>, December 16, 1830, "Mr. Macready
appeared to very great advantage. We have never seen him exert himself
more&mdash;we have never known him to exert himself with more powerful
effect. Three of his scenes were masterpieces." Genest says that
<i>Werner</i> was acted seventeen times in 1830-31.</p>

<p>There was a revival in 1833. Macready says (<i>Diary</i>, March 20) that he
acted "'Werner' with unusual force, truth, and collectedness ...
finished off each burst of passion, and, in consequence, entered on the
following emotion with clearness and earnestness" (Macready's
<i>Reminiscences</i>, 1875, i 36.6).</p>

<p><i>Werner</i> was played in 1834, 5, 6, 7, 9; in 1841; in 1843-4 (New York,
Boston, Baltimore, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Montreal); in 1845 (Paris,
London, Glasgow, Belfast, Dublin); in 1846, 1847; in America in 1848; in
the provinces in 1849; in 1850; and, for the last time, at the Theatre
Royal, Haymarket, January 14, 1851. At the farewell performance Macready
appeared as "Werner," Mr. Davenport as "Ulric," Mrs. Warner as
"Josephine," Mrs. Ryder as "Ida." In the same year (1851) a portrait of
Macready as "Werner," by Daniel Maclise, R.A., was on view at the
Exhibition at the Royal Academy. The motto was taken from <i>Werner</i>, act
i. sc. 1, lines 114, <i>sq.</i> (See, for a detailed criticism of Macready's
"Werner," <i>Our Recent Actors</i>, by Westland Marston, 1881, i. 89-98; and
for the famous "Macready <i>burst</i>," in act ii. sc. 2, and act v. sc. 1,
<i>vide ibid.</i>, i. 97.)</p>

<p><i>Werner</i> was brought out at Sadler's Wells Theatre, November 21, 1860,
and repeated November 22, 23, 24, 28, 29; December, 3, 4, 11, 13, 14,
1860. Phelps appeared as "Werner," Mr. Edmund Phelps as "Ulric," Miss
Atkinson as "Josephine." "Perhaps the old actor never performed the part
so finely as he did on that night. The identity between the real and
ideal relations of the characters was as vivid to him as to the
audience, and gave a deeper intensity, on both sides, to the scenes
between father and son." (See <i>The London Stage</i>, by H. Barton Baker,
1889, ii. 217.)</p>

<p>On the afternoon of June 1, 1887, <i>Werner</i> (four acts, arranged by Frank
Marshall) was performed at the Lyceum Theatre for the benefit of
Westland Marston. [Sir] Henry Irving appeared as "Werner," Miss Ellen
Terry as "Josephine," Mr. Alexander as "Ulric." (See for an appreciation
of Sir Henry Irving's presentation of <i>Werner</i>, the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, June 4,
1887.)]</p>

<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>


<p><i><span class="smcap">Werner</span>; or, The Inheritance</i>, was begun at Pisa, December 18, 1821, and
finished January 20, 1822. At the end of the month, January 29, Byron
despatched the MS., not to Murray, but to Moore, then in retreat at
Paris, intending, no doubt, that it should be placed in the hands of
another publisher; but a letter from Murray "melted him," and on March
6, 1822 (<i>Letters</i>, 1901, vi. 34), he desired Moore to forward the
packet to Albemarle Street. The play was set up in type, and revised
proofs were returned to Murray at the end of June; but, for various
reasons, publication was withheld, and, on October 31, Byron informed
John Hunt that he had empowered his friend Douglas Kinnaird to obtain
<i>Werner</i>, with other MSS., from Murray. None the less, milder counsels
again prevailed, and on Saturday, November 23, 1822, <i>Werner</i> was
published, not in the same volume with <i>Heaven and Earth</i>, as Byron
intended and expected, nor by John Hunt, as he had threatened, but by
itself, and, as heretofore, by John Murray. <i>Werner</i> was "the last of
all the flock" to issue from Murray's fold.</p>

<p>In his Preface to <i>Werner</i> (<i>vide post</i>, <a href="#Page_337">p. 337</a>) Byron disclaims all
pretensions to originality. "The following drama," he writes, "is taken
entirely from the 'German's Tale, Kruitzner,' published ... in Lee's
<i>Canterbury Tales</i>.... I have adopted the characters, plan, and even the
language, of many parts of this story." <i>Kruitzner</i> seems to have made a
deep impression on his mind. When he was a boy of thirteen (<i>i.e.</i> in
1801, when the fourth volume of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> was published),
and again in 1815, he set himself to turn the tale into a drama. His
first attempt, named <i>Ulric and Ilvina</i>, he threw into the fire, but he
had nearly completed the first act of his second and maturer adaptation
when he was "interrupted by circumstances," that is, no doubt, the
circumstances which led up to and ended in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span> the separation from his
wife. (See letter of October 9, 1821, <i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 391.)</p>

<p>On his leaving England for the Continent, April 25, 1816, the fragment
was left behind. Most probably the MS. fell into his sister's hands, for
in October, 1821, it was not forthcoming when Byron gave directions that
Hobhouse should search for it "amongst my papers." Ultimately it came
into the possession of the late Mr. Murray, and is now printed for the
first time in its entirety (<i>vide post</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_453">453</a>-466: selections were
given in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, August, 1899). It should be borne in
mind that this unprinted first act of <i>Werner</i>, which synchronizes with
the <i>Siege of Corinth</i> and <i>Parisina</i>, was written when Byron was a
member of the sub-committee of management of Drury Lane Theatre, and, as
the numerous stage directions testify, with a view to
stage-representation. The MS. is scored with corrections, and betrays an
unusual elaboration, and, perhaps, some difficulty and hesitation in the
choice of words and the construction of sentences. In the opening scene
the situation is not caught and gripped, while the melancholy squalor of
the original narrative is only too faithfully reproduced. The <i>Werner</i>
of 1821, with all its shortcomings, is the production of a playwright.
The <i>Werner</i> of 1815 is the attempt of a highly gifted amateur.</p>

<p>When Byron once more bethought himself of his old subject, he not only
sent for the MS. of the first act, but desired Murray "to cut out Sophia
Lee's" (<i>vide post</i>, <a href="#Page_337">p. 337</a>) "<i>German's Tale</i> from the <i>Canterbury
Tales</i>, and send it in a letter" (<i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 390). He seems to
have intended from the first to construct a drama out of the story, and,
no doubt, to acknowledge the source of his inspiration. On the whole, he
carried out his intention, taking places, characters, and incidents as
he found them, but recasting the materials and turning prose into metre.
But here and there, to save himself trouble, he "stole his brooms ready
made," and, as he acknowledges in the Preface, "adopted even the
language of the story." Act ii. sc. 2, lines 87-172; act iii. sc. 4; and
act v. sc. 1, lines 94-479, are, more or less, faithful and exact
reproductions of pp. 203-206, 228-232, and 252-271 of the novel (see
<i>Canterbury Tales</i>, ed. 1832, vol. ii.). On the other hand, in the
remaining three-fourths of the play, the language is not Miss Lee's, but
Byron's, and the "conveyance" of incidents occasional and insignificant.
Much, too, was imported into the play (<i>e.g.</i> almost the whole of the
fourth act), of which there is neither hint nor suggestion in the story.
Maginn's categorical statement (see "O'Doherty on <i>Werner</i>,"
<i>Miscellanies</i>, 1885, i. 189) that "here Lord Byron has <i>invented</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
nothing&mdash;absolutely, positively, undeniably <span class="smcap">nothing</span>;" that "there is not
one incident in his play, not even the most trivial, that is not to be
found in the novel," etc., is "positively and undeniably" a falsehood.
Maginn read <i>Werner</i> for the purpose of attacking Byron, and, by
printing selected passages from the novel and the play, in parallel
columns, gives the reader to understand that he had made an exhaustive
analysis of the original and the copy. The review, which is quoted as an
authority in the editions of 1832 (xiv. pp. 113, 114) and 1837, etc., p.
341, is disingenuous and misleading.</p>

<p>The original story may be briefly retold. The prodigal and outlawed son
of a Bohemian noble, Count Siegendorf, after various adventures,
marries, under the assumed name of Friedrich Kruitzner, the daughter of
an Italian scholar and man of science, of noble birth, but in narrow
circumstances. A son, Conrad, is born to him, who, at eight years of
age, is transferred to the charge of his grandfather. Twelve years go
by, and, when the fortunes of the younger Siegendorf are at their lowest
ebb, he learns, at the same moment, that his father is dead, and that a
distant kinsman, the Baron Stralenheim, is meditating an attack on his
person, with a view to claiming his inheritance. Of Conrad, who has
disappeared, he hears nothing.</p>

<p>An accident compels the count and the baron to occupy adjoining quarters
in a small town on the northern frontier of Silesia; and, again, another
accident places the usurping and intriguing baron at the mercy of his
poverty-stricken and exiled kinsman. Stralenheim has fallen asleep near
the fire in his easy-chair. Papers and several rouleaux of gold are
ranged on a cabinet beside the bed. Kruitzner, who is armed with "a
large and sharp knife," is suddenly confronted with his unarmed and
slumbering foe, and though habit and conscience conspire to make murder
impossible, he yields to a sudden and irresistible impulse, and snatches
up "the portion of gold which is nearest." He has no sooner returned to
his wife and confessed his deed, than Conrad suddenly appears on the
scene, and at the very moment of an unexpected and joyous reunion with
his parents, learns that his father is a thief. Kruitzner pleads "guilty
with extenuating circumstances," and Conrad, who either is or pretends
to be disgusted at his father's sophistries, makes the best of a bad
business, and undertakes to conceal his father's dishonour and rescue
him from the power of Stralenheim. The plot hinges on the unlooked-for
and unsuspected action of Conrad. Unlike his father, he is not the man
to let "I dare not wait upon I would," but murders Stralenheim in cold
blood, and, at the same time, diverts suspicion from his father and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
himself to the person of his comrade, a Hungarian soldier of fortune,
who is already supposed to be the thief, and who had sought and obtained
shelter in the apartments of the conscience-stricken Kruitzner.</p>

<p>The scene changes to Prague. Siegendorf, no longer Kruitzner, has
regained his inheritance, and is once more at the height of splendour
and prosperity. A service of thanksgiving is being held in the cathedral
to commemorate the signature of the Treaty of Prague (1635), and the
count is present in state. Suddenly he catches sight of the Hungarian,
and, "like a flash of lightning" feels and remembers that he <i>is</i> a
thief, and that he might, however unjustly, be suspected if not accused
of the murder of Stralenheim. The service is over, and the count is
recrossing "Muldau's Bridge," when he hears the fatal word <i>Kruitzner</i>,
"the seal of his shame," spoken in his ear. He returns to his castle,
and issues orders that the Hungarian should be arrested and
interrogated. An interview takes place, at which the Hungarian denounces
Conrad as the murderer of Stralenheim. The son acknowledges the deed,
and upbraids the father for his weakness and credulity in supposing that
his escape from Stralenheim's machinations could have been effected by
any other means. If, he argues, circumstances can palliate dishonesty,
they can compel and justify murder. Common sense even now demands the
immediate slaughter of the Hungarian, as it compelled and sanctioned the
effectual silencing of Stralenheim. But Siegendorf knows not "thorough,"
and shrinks at assassination. He repudiates and denounces his son, and
connives at the escape of the Hungarian. Conrad, who is banished from
Prague, rejoins his former associates, the "black bands," which were the
scandal and terror of the neighbouring provinces, and is killed in a
skirmish with the regular troops. Siegendorf dies of a broken heart.</p>

<p>The conception of <i>The German's Tale</i>, as Byron perceived, is superior
to the execution. The style is laboured and involved, and the narrative
long-winded and tiresome. It is, perhaps, an adaptation, though not a
literal translation, of a German historical romance. But the <i>motif</i>&mdash;a
son predestined to evil by the weakness and sensuality of his father, a
father punished for his want of rectitude by the passionate criminality
of his son, is the very key-note of tragedy.</p>

<p>If from haste or indolence Byron scamped his task, and cut up whole
cantles of the novel into nerveless and pointless blank verse, here and
there throughout the play, in scattered lines and passages, he outdoes
himself. The inspiration is fitful, but supreme.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Note to the Introduction to</span>
<i><span class="smcap">Werner</span></i>.
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h3>

<p>In an article entitled, "Did Byron write <i>Werner</i>?" which appeared in
the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> (August, 1899, vol. 46, pp. 243-250), the Hon.
F. Leveson Gower undertakes to prove that <i>Werner</i> was not written by
Lord Byron, but by Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire (born June 9, 1757,
died March 30, 1806). He adduces, in support of this claim, (1) a
statement made to him by his sister, the late Lady Georgiana Fullerton,
to the effect that their grandmother, the duchess, "wrote the poem and
gave the MS. to her niece, Lady Caroline Ponsonby (better known as Lady
Caroline Lamb), and that she, some years later, handed it over to Lord
Byron, who, in 1822, published it in his own name;" (2) a letter written
in 1822 by his mother, Lady Granville, to her sister, Lady Carlisle,
which asserts that their mother, the duchess, "wrote an entire tragedy
from Miss Lee's <i>Kreutzner the Hungarian</i> (<i>sic</i>)," and that the MS. had
been sent to her by Lady Caroline's brother, Mr. William Ponsonby, and
was in her possession; (3) another letter of Lady Granville's, dated
December 3, 1822, in which she informs her sister that her husband, Lord
Granville, had promised to read <i>Werner</i> aloud to her (i.e. Byron's
<i>Werner</i>, published November 23, 1822), a promise which, if fulfilled,
must have revealed one of two things&mdash;the existence of two dramas based
on Miss Lee's <i>Kruitzner</i>, or the identity of Byron's version with that
of the duchess. Now, argues Mr. Leveson Gower, if Lady Granville had
known that two dramas were in existence, she would not have allowed her
daughter, Lady Georgiana Fullerton, to believe "that the duchess was the
author of the published poem."</p>

<p>I will deal with the external evidence first. Practically it amounts to
this: (1) that Lady Granville knew that her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span> mother, the Duchess of
Devonshire, dramatized Miss Lee's <i>Kruitzner</i>; and (2) that Lady
Georgiana Fullerton believed that the duchess gave the MS. of her play
to Lady Caroline Ponsonby, and that, many years after, Lady Caroline
handed it over to Byron.</p>

<p>The external evidence establishes the fact that the Duchess of
Devonshire dramatized <i>Kruitzner</i>, but it does not prove that Byron
purloined her adaptation. It records an unverified impression on the
part of the duchess's granddaughter, that the MS. of a play written
between the years 1801-1806, passed into Byron's hands about the year
1813; that he took a copy of the MS.; and that in 1821-22 he caused his
copy to be retranscribed and published under his own name.</p>

<p>But Mr. Leveson Gower appeals to internal as well as external evidence,
(1) He regards the great inferiority of <i>Werner</i> to Byron's published
plays, and to the genuine (hitherto) unpublished first act, together
with the wholesale plagiarisms from Miss Lee's story, as an additional
proof that the work was none of his. (2) He notes, as a suspicious
circumstance, that "while the rough copies of his other poems have been
preserved, no rough copy of <i>Werner</i> is to be found."</p>

<p>In conclusion, he deals with two possible objections which may be
brought against his theory: (1) that Byron would not have incurred the
risk of detection at the hands of the owners of the duchess's MS.; and
(2) that a great poet of assured fame and reputation could have had no
possible motive for perpetrating a literary fraud. The first objection
he answers by assuming that Byron would have counted on the reluctance
of the "Ponsonby family and the daughters of the Duchess" to rake up the
ashes of old scandals; the second, by pointing out that, in 1822, he was
making "frantic endeavours to obtain money, not for himself, but to help
the cause of Greece."</p>

<p>(1) With regard to the marked inferiority of <i>Werner</i> to Byron's other
plays, and the relative proportion of adapted to original matter, Mr.
Leveson Gower appears to have been misled by the disingenuous criticism
of Maginn and other contemporary reviewers (<i>vide</i> the Introduction,
etc., <a href="#Page_326">p. 326</a>). There is no such inferiority, and the plagiarisms, which
were duly acknowledged, are confined to certain limited portions of the
play. (2) There is nothing unusual in the fact that the rough draft of
<i>Werner</i> cannot be found. In fact, but few of the early drafts of the
dramas and other poems written in the later Italian days ever reached
Murray's hands, or are still in existence. The fair copy for the printer
alone was sent home. The time had gone by when Byron's publisher, who
was also his friend, would stipulate that "all the original
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
MSS., copies and scraps" should fall to his share. But no argument can be
founded on so insignificant a circumstance.</p>

<p>Finally, the argument on which Mr. Leveson Gower dwells at some length,
that Byron's "motive" for perpetrating a literary fraud was the
necessity for raising money for the cause of Greek independence, is
refuted by the fact that <i>Werner</i> was begun in December, 1821, and
finished in January, 1822, and that it was not till the spring of 1823
that he was elected a member of the Greek Committee, or had any occasion
to raise funds for the maintenance of troops or the general expenses of
the war. So far from attempting to raise money by <i>Werner</i>, in letters
to Murray, dated March 6, October 24, November 18, 1822, he emphatically
waives the question of "terms," and makes no demand or request for money
whatever. It was not till December 23, 1823 (<i>Letters</i>, 1901, vi. 287),
two years after the play had been written, that he speaks of applying
the two or three hundred pounds which the copyright of <i>Werner</i> might be
worth, to the maintenance of armed men in the service of the
<i>Provisional Government</i>. He could not have "purloined" and palmed off
as his own the duchess's version of Miss Lee's story in order to raise
money for a purpose which had not arisen. He had no intention at first
or last of presenting the copyright of <i>Werner</i> to Murray or Hunt, but
he was willing to wait for his money, and had no motive for raising
funds by an illegal and dishonourable trick.</p>

<p>That Byron did <i>not</i> write <i>Werner</i> is, surely, non-proven on the
external and internal evidence adduced by Mr. Leveson Gower. On the
other hand, there is abundant evidence, both external and internal,
that, apart from his acknowledged indebtedness to Miss Lee's story, he
did write <i>Werner</i>.</p>

<p>To take the external evidence first. On the first page of Mrs. Shelley's
transcript of <i>Werner</i>, Byron inserted the date, "Dec. 18, 1821," and on
the last he wrote "[The End] of fifth act of the Drama. B. P[isa]. Jy
21. 1822."</p>

<p>Turning to the journal of Edward Williams (Shelley's <i>Prose Works</i>,
1880, iv. 318), I find the following entries:&mdash;</p>

<p>"December 21, 1821. Lord B. told me that he had commenced a tragedy from
Miss Lee's <i>German Tale</i> ('<i>Werner</i>'), and had been fagging at it all
day."</p>

<p>"January 8, 1822. Mary read us the first two acts of Lord B.'s
<i>Werner</i>."</p>

<p>Again, in an unpublished diary of the same period it is recorded that
Mrs. Shelley was engaged in the task of copying on January 17, 1822, and
the eight following days, and that on January 25 she finished her
transcript.</p>

<p>Again, Medwin (<i>Conversations</i>, 1824, p. 409) records the fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span> that
Byron told him "that he had almost finished another play ... called
<i>Werner</i>;" and (p. 412) "that <i>Werner</i> was written in twenty-eight days,
and one entire act at a sitting." It is almost incredible that Byron
should have recopied a copy of the duchess's play in order to impose on
Mrs. Shelley and Williams and Medwin; and it is quite incredible that
they were in the plot, and lent themselves to the deception. It is
certain that both Williams and Medwin believed that Byron was the author
of <i>Werner</i>, and it is certain that nothing would have induced Mrs.
Shelley to be <i>particeps criminis</i>&mdash;to copy a play which was not
Byron's, to be published as Byron's, and to suffer her copy to be
fraudulently endorsed by her guilty accomplice.</p>

<p>The internal evidence of the genuineness of <i>Werner</i> is still more
convincing. In the first place, there are numerous "undesigned
coincidences," allusions, and phrases to be found in <i>Werner</i> and
elsewhere in Byron's <i>Poetical Works</i>, which bear his sign-manual, and
cannot be attributed to another writer; and, secondly, scattered through
the play there are numerous lines, passages, allusions&mdash;"a cloud of
witnesses" to their Byronic inspiration and creation.</p>

<p>Take the following parallels:&mdash;</p>

great personage ... is drowned below the ford, with five post-horses, A
monkey and a mastiff&mdash;and a valet," with the corresponding passage in
<i>Kruitzner</i> and in Byron's unfinished fragment; and note that "the
monkey, the mastiff, and the valet," which formed part of Byron's
retinue in 1821, are conspicuous by their absence from Miss Lee's story
and the fragment.</p>

<p>Space precludes the quotation of further parallels, and for specimens of

<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>

<p>The following drama is taken entirely from the <i>German's Tale,
Kruitzner</i>, published many years ago in "Lee's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>"
written (I believe) by two sisters, of whom one furnished only this
story and another, both of which are considered superior to the
remainder of the collection.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> I have adopted the characters, plan,
and even the language of many parts of this story. Some of the
characters are modified or altered, a few of the names changed, and one
character (Ida of Stralenheim) added by myself: but in the rest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span> the
original is chiefly followed. When I was young (about fourteen, I
think,) I first read this tale, which made a deep impression upon me;
and may, indeed, be said to contain the germ of much that I have since
written. I am not sure that it ever was very popular; or, at any rate,
its popularity has since been eclipsed by that of other great writers in
the same department. But I have generally found that those who <i>had</i>
read it, agreed with me in their estimate of the singular power of mind
and conception which it developes. I should also add <i>conception</i>,
rather than execution; for the story might, perhaps, have been developed
with greater advantage. Amongst those whose opinions agreed with mine
upon this story, I could mention some very high names: but it is not
necessary, nor indeed of any use; for every one must judge according to
his own feelings. I merely refer the reader to the original story, that
he may see to what extent I have borrowed from it; and am not unwilling
that he should find much greater pleasure in perusing it than the drama
which is founded upon its contents.</p>

<p>I had begun a drama upon this tale so far back as 1815, (the first I
ever attempted, except one at thirteen years old, called "Ulric and
Ilvina," which I had sense enough to burn,) and had nearly completed an
act, when I was interrupted by circumstances. This is somewhere amongst
my papers in England; but as it has not been found, I have re-written
the first, and added the subsequent acts.</p>

<p>The whole is neither intended, nor in any shape adapted, for the
stage<a name="FNanchor_cm" id="FNanchor_cm"></a><a href="#Footnote_cm" class="fnanchor">[cm]</a>.</p>

<p>But lodged so far off, in the other wing,<span class="linenum">20</span></p>
<p>By which there's no communication with</p>
<p>The baron's chamber, that it can't be he.</p>
<p>Besides, I bade him "good night" in the hall,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>
<p>Almost a mile off, and which only leads</p>
<p>To his own apartment, about the same time</p>
<p>When this burglarious, larcenous felony</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Iden</i>.<span class="s26">&zwj;</span>No&mdash;not <i>you</i>,</p>
<p>But some of the inferior knaves. You say</p>
<p>The Baron was asleep in the great chair&mdash;</p>
<p>The velvet chair&mdash;in his embroidered night-gown;</p>
<p>His toilet spread before him, and upon it</p>
<p>A cabinet with letters, papers, and</p>
<p>Several rouleaux of gold; of which <i>one</i> only</p>
<p>Has disappeared:&mdash;the door unbolted, with</p>
<p>No difficult access to any.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Fritz</i>.<span class="s19">&zwj;</span>Good sir,</p>
<p>Be not so quick; the honour of the corps<span class="linenum">40</span></p>
<p>Which forms the Baron's household's unimpeached</p>
<p>From steward to scullion, save in the fair way</p>
<p>Of peculation; such as in accompts,</p>
<p>Weights, measures, larder, cellar, buttery,</p>
<p>Where all men take their prey; as also in</p>
<p>Postage of letters, gathering of rents,</p>
<p>Purveying feasts, and understanding with</p>
<p>The honest trades who furnish noble masters<a name="FNanchor_cq" id="FNanchor_cq"></a><a href="#Footnote_cq" class="fnanchor">[cq]</a>;</p>
<p>But for your petty, picking, downright thievery,</p>
<p>We scorn it as we do board wages. Then<span class="linenum">50</span></p>
<p>Had one of our folks done it, he would not</p>
<p>Have been so poor a spirit as to hazard</p>
<p>His neck for <i>one</i> rouleau, but have swooped all;</p>
<p>Also the cabinet, if portable.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Iden</i>. There is some sense in that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fritz</i>.<span class="s27">&zwj;</span>No, Sir, be sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>
<p>'Twas none of our corps; but some petty, trivial</p>
<p>Picker and stealer, without art or genius.</p>
<p>The only question is&mdash;Who else could have</p>
<p>Access, save the Hungarian and yourself?</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Iden</i>. You don't mean me?</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Fritz</i>.<span class="s18">&zwj;</span>No, sir; I honour more<span class="linenum">60</span></p>
<p>Your talents&mdash;&mdash;</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Iden</i>.<span class="s11">&zwj;</span>And my principles, I hope.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Fritz</i>. Of course. But to the point: What's to be done?</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Iden</i>. Nothing&mdash;but there's a good deal to be said.</p>
<p>We'll offer a reward; move heaven and earth,</p>
<p>And the police (though there's none nearer than</p>
<p>Frankfort); post notices in manuscript</p>
<p>(For we've no printer); and set by my clerk</p>
<p>To read them (for few can, save he and I).</p>
<p>We'll send out villains to strip beggars, and</p>
<p>Search empty pockets; also, to arrest<span class="linenum">70</span></p>
<p>All gipsies, and ill-clothed and sallow people.</p>
<p>Prisoners we'll have at least, if not the culprit;</p>
<p>And for the Baron's gold&mdash;if 'tis not found,</p>
<p>At least he shall have the full satisfaction</p>
<p>Of melting twice its substance in the raising</p>
<p>The ghost of this rouleau. Here's alchemy</p>
<p>For your Lord's losses!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Fritz</i>.<span class="s15">&zwj;</span>He hath found a better.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Iden</i>. <i>Where?</i></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Fritz</i>.<span class="s8">&zwj;</span>In a most immense inheritance.</p>
<p>The late Count Siegendorf, his distant kinsman,</p>
<p>Is dead near Prague, in his castle, and my Lord<span class="linenum">80</span></p>
<p>Is on his way to take possession.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Iden</i>.<span class="s26">&zwj;</span>Was there</p>
<p>No heir?</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Fritz</i>. Oh, yes; but he has disappeared</p>
<p>Long from the world's eye, and, perhaps, the world.</p>
<p>A prodigal son, beneath his father's ban</p>
<p>For the last twenty years; for whom his sire</p>
<p>Refused to kill the fatted calf; and, therefore,</p>
<p>If living, he must chew the husks still. But</p>
<p>The Baron would find means to silence him,</p>
<p>Were he to re-appear: he's politic,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>
<p>And has much influence with a certain court.<span class="linenum">90</span></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Iden</i>. He's fortunate.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Fritz</i>.<span class="s15">&zwj;</span>'Tis true, there is a grandson,</p>
<p>Whom the late Count reclaimed from his son's hands,</p>
<p>And educated as his heir; but, then,</p>
<p>His birth is doubtful.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Iden</i>.<span class="s15">&zwj;</span>How so?</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Fritz</i>.<span class="s23">&zwj;</span>His sire made</p>
<p>A left-hand, love, imprudent sort of marriage,</p>
<p>With an Italian exile's dark-eyed daughter:</p>
<p>Noble, they say, too; but no match for such</p>
<p>A house as Siegendorf's. The grandsire ill</p>
<p>Could brook the alliance; and could ne'er be brought</p>
<p>To see the parents, though he took the son.<span class="linenum">100</span></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Iden</i>. If he's a lad of mettle, he may yet</p>
<p>Dispute your claim, and weave a web that may</p>
<p>Puzzle your Baron to unravel.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Fritz</i>.<span class="s21">&zwj;</span>Why,</p>
<p>For mettle, he has quite enough: they say,</p>
<p>He forms a happy mixture of his sire</p>
<p>And grandsire's qualities,&mdash;impetuous as</p>
<p>The former, and deep as the latter; but</p>
<p>The strangest is, that he too disappeared</p>
<p>Some months ago.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Iden</i>.<span class="s12">&zwj;</span>The devil he did!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Fritz</i>.<span class="s28">&zwj;</span>Why, yes:</p>
<p>It must have been at <i>his</i> suggestion, at<span class="linenum">110</span></p>
<p>An hour so critical as was the eve</p>
<p>Of the old man's death, whose heart was broken by it.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Iden</i>. Was there no cause assigned?</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Fritz</i>.<span class="s28">&zwj;</span>Plenty, no doubt,</p>
<p>And none, perhaps, the true one. Some averred</p>
<p>It was to seek his parents; some because</p>
<p>The old man held his spirit in so strictly</p>
<p>(But that could scarce be, for he doted on him);</p>
<p>A third believed he wished to serve in war,</p>
<p>But, peace being made soon after his departure,</p>
<p>He might have since returned, were that the motive;<span class="linenum">120</span></p>
<p>A fourth set charitably have surmised,</p>
<p>As there was something strange and mystic in him,</p>
<p>That in the wild exuberance of his nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>
<p>He had joined the black bands<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>, who lay waste Lusatia,</p>
<p>The mountains of Bohemia and Silesia,</p>
<p>Since the last years of war had dwindled into</p>
<p>A kind of general condottiero system</p>
<p>Of bandit-warfare; each troop with its chief,</p>
<p>And all against mankind.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Iden</i>.<span class="s18">&zwj;</span>That cannot be.</p>
<p>A young heir, bred to wealth and luxury,<span class="linenum">130</span></p>
<p>To risk his life and honours with disbanded</p>
<p>Soldiers and desperadoes!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Fritz</i>.<span class="s19">&zwj;</span>Heaven best knows!</p>
<p>But there are human natures so allied</p>
<p>Unto the savage love of enterprise,</p>
<p>That they will seek for peril as a pleasure.</p>
<p>I've heard that nothing can reclaim your Indian,</p>
<p>Or tame the tiger, though their infancy</p>
<p>Were fed on milk and honey. After all,</p>
<p>Your Wallenstein, your Tilly and Gustavus,</p>
<p>Your Bannier, and your Torstenson and Weimar<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>,<span class="linenum">140</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>
<p>Were but the same thing upon a grand scale;</p>
<p>And now that they are gone, and peace proclaimed,</p>
<p>They who would follow the same pastime must</p>
<p>Pursue it on their own account. Here comes</p>
<p>The Baron, and the Saxon stranger, who</p>
<p>Was his chief aid in yesterday's escape,</p>
<p>But did not leave the cottage by the Oder</p>
<p>Until this morning.</p>

<p>But he hath played the truant in some hour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>
<p>Of freakish folly, leaving fortune to</p>
<p>Champion his claims. That's well. The father, whom</p>
<p>For years I've tracked, as does the blood-hound, never</p>

<p>Rise not the higher (and the weather favours</p>

<p>Within a dungeon, where he may avouch</p>
<p>His real estate and name; and there's no harm done,</p>
<p>Should he prove other than I deem. This robbery</p>
<p>(Save for the actual loss) is lucky also;</p>
<p>He's poor, and that's suspicious&mdash;he's unknown,<span class="linenum">290</span></p>
<p>And that's defenceless.&mdash;True, we have no proofs</p>
<p>Of guilt&mdash;but what hath he of innocence?</p>
<p>Were he a man indifferent to my prospects,</p>
<p>In other bearings, I should rather lay</p>
<p>The inculpation on the Hungarian, who</p>
<p>Hath something which I like not; and alone</p>

<p>Could never tempt the man who knows its worth,</p>
<p>Weighed at its proper value in the balance,</p>
<p>Save in such guise (and there I grant its power,</p>

<p>To suffer martyrdom, at least with such</p>
<p>An epitaph as larceny upon my tomb.</p>

<p><i>Eric</i>. So, better times are come at last; to these</p>

<p><i>Hen</i>.<span class="s15">&zwj;</span>Yes, for <i>masters</i>,</p>
<p>It might be unto those who long for novelty,</p>
<p>Though made by a new grave: but, as for wassail,</p>
<p>Methinks the old Count Siegendorf maintained</p>
<p>His feudal hospitality as high</p>
<p>As e'er another Prince of the empire.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Eric</i>.<span class="s28">&zwj;</span>Why</p>
<p>For the mere cup and trencher, we no doubt</p>

<p>And sport, without which salt and sauces season</p>
<p>The cheer but scantily, our sizings were</p>
<p>Even of the narrowest.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Hen</i>.<span class="s16">&zwj;</span>The old count loved not</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Hen</i>.<span class="s14">&zwj;</span>His reign is as yet</p>

</div><div class="stanza">

<p>The wars are over: in the hall, who like</p>

<p>Which awes, but yet offends not? in the field,</p>
<p>Who like him with his spear in hand, when gnashing<span class="linenum">30</span></p>
<p>His tusks, and ripping up, from right to left,</p>
<p>The howling hounds, the boar makes for the thicket?</p>
<p>Who backs a horse, or bears a hawk, or wears</p>
<p>A sword like him? Whose plume nods knightlier?</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Hen</i>. No one's, I grant you. Do not fear, if war</p>

</div><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">

<p>Of words, no more; besides, had it been otherwise,</p>

<p>And she, no doubt, will soften whatsoever</p>

<p>A winter in obscurity, it was</p>
<p>My chance at several places of resort</p>

<p>To hear related a strange circumstance</p>
<p>In February last. A martial force,</p>
<p>Sent by the state, had, after strong resistance,<span class="linenum">230</span></p>
<p>Secured a band of desperate men, supposed</p>
<p>Marauders from the hostile camp.&mdash;They proved,</p>
<p>However, not to be so&mdash;but banditti,</p>
<p>Whom either accident or enterprise</p>
<p>Had carried from their usual haunt&mdash;the forests</p>
<p>Which skirt Bohemia&mdash;even into Lusatia.</p>
<p>Many amongst them were reported of</p>
<p>High rank&mdash;and martial law slept for a time.</p>
<p>At last they were escorted o'er the frontiers,</p>
<p>And placed beneath the civil jurisdiction<span class="linenum">240</span></p>
<p>Of the free town of Frankfort. Of <i>their</i> fate</p>

<p>Of wonderful endowments:&mdash;birth and fortune,</p>
<p>Youth, strength, and beauty, almost superhuman,</p>
<p>And courage as unrivalled, were proclaimed</p>
<p>His by the public rumour; and his sway,</p>
<p>Not only over his associates, but</p>
<p>His judges, was attributed to witchcraft,</p>
<p>Such was his influence:&mdash;I have no great faith<span class="linenum">250</span></p>

Two Emilys</i> and <i>The Clergyman's Tale, or Pembroke</i>, were contributed by
Sophia Lee. <i>Kruitzner, or The Germans Tale</i>, was written by Harriet Lee
(1757-1851), the younger of the sisters. Miss Lee began her literary
career as a dramatist. A comedy, <i>The New Peerage; or, Our Eyes may
deceive us</i>, was played at Drury Lane, November 10, 1787. In 1798 she
published <i>The Mysterious Marriage; or, The Heirship of Rosalva</i>. After
the publication of Byron's <i>Werner</i>, she wrote a dramatic version of
<i>The German's Tale</i>, under the title of <i>The Three Strangers</i>. It was
brought out at Covent Garden, December 10, 1825, and acted four times.
</p><p>
The first volume of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, by Harriet Lee, was
published in 1797; the second volume, by Sophia Lee, in 1798 (a second
edition of these volumes was published in 1799); a third volume (second
edition), by Sophia and Harriet Lee, appeared in 1800; the fourth
volume, by Harriet Lee (which contains <i>The German's Tale</i>, pp. 3-368)
was published in 1801; and the fifth volume, by Harriet Lee, in 1805.
</p><p>
There can be little doubt that Byron's visit to Churchill's grave at
Dover, which took place April 25, 1816 (see <i>Poetical Works</i>, 1901, iv.
45), was suggested by a passage in the <i>Introduction</i>, pp. vii.-ix., to
the first volume (1797) of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. The author "wanders
forth to note the <i>memorabilia</i> of Dover," is informed that "the
greatest curiosity in the place is the tomb of a poet," and hastens "to
a spot surrounded by ruined walls, in the midst of which stood the white
marble tablet marked with Churchill's name," etc.]</p></div>

vol. 36, p. 422). "A drama is not merely a dialogue, but <i>an action</i>:
and necessarily supposes that something is to pass before the eyes of
assembled spectators.... If an author does not bear this continually in
his mind, and does not write in the ideal presence of an eager and
diversified assemblage, he may be a poet, perhaps, but assuredly he will
never be a dramatist."]

too, something of a paradox that Byron should be eager to shelter

made in 1815, not in 1821, and it is far more probable that Byron called
his hero "Werner," because "Kruitzner" is unrhythmical, or simply

<i>THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED</i>.
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> date of the original MS. of <i>The Deformed Transformed</i> is "Pisa,
1822." There is nothing to show in what month it was written, but it may
be conjectured that it was begun and finished within the period which
elapsed between the death of Allegra, April 20, and the death of
Shelley, July 8, 1822. According to Medwin (<i>Conversations</i>, 1824, p.
227), an unfavourable criticism of Shelley's ("It is a bad imitation of
<i>Faust</i>"), together with a discovery that "two entire lines" of
Southey's&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"And water shall see thee,</p>
<p>And fear thee, and flee thee"&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p>were imbedded in one of his "Songs," touched Byron so deeply that he
"threw the poem into the fire," and concealed the existence of a second
copy for more than two years. It is a fact that Byron's correspondence
does not contain the remotest allusion to <i>The Deformed Transformed</i>;
but, with regard to the plagiarism from Southey, in the play as written
in 1822 there is neither Song nor Incantation which could have contained
two lines from <i>The Curse of Kehama</i>.</p>

<p>As a dramatist, Byron's function, or <i>m&eacute;tier</i>, was twofold. In
<i>Manfred</i>, in <i>Cain</i>, in <i>Heaven and Earth</i>, he is concerned with the
analysis and evolution of metaphysical or ethical notions; in <i>Marino
Faliero</i>, in <i>Sardanapalus</i>, and <i>The Two Foscari</i>, he set himself "to
dramatize striking passages of history;" in <i>The Deformed Transformed</i>
he sought to combine the solution of a metaphysical puzzle or problem,
the relation of personality to individuality, with the scenic rendering
of a striking historical episode, the Sack of Rome in 1527.</p>

<p>In the note or advertisement prefixed to the drama, Byron acknowledges
that "the production" is founded partly on the story of a forgotten
novel, <i>The Three Brothers</i>, and partly on "the <i>Faust</i> of the great
Goethe."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>

<p>Arnaud, or Julian, the hero of <i>The Three Brothers</i> (by Joshua
Pickersgill, jun., 4 vols., 1803), "sells his soul to the Devil, and
becomes an arch-fiend in order to avenge himself for the taunts of
strangers on the deformity of his person" (see <i>Gent. Mag.</i>, November,
1804, vol. 74, p. 1047; and <i>post</i>, pp. 473-479). The idea of an escape
from natural bonds or disabilities by supernatural means and at the
price of the soul or will, the <i>un</i>-Christlike surrender to the tempter,
which is the <i>grund-stoff</i> of the Faust-legend, was brought home to
Byron, in the first instance, not by Goethe, or Calderon, or Marlowe,
but by Joshua Pickersgill. A fellow-feeling lent an intimate and
peculiar interest to the theme. He had suffered all his life from a
painful and inconvenient defect, which his proud and sensitive spirit
had magnified into a deformity. He had been stung to the quick by his
mother's taunts and his sweetheart's ridicule, by the jeers of the base
and thoughtless, by slanderous and brutal paragraphs in newspapers. He
could not forget that he was lame. If his enemies had but possessed the
wit, they might have given him "the sobriquet of <i>Le Diable Boiteux</i>"
(letter to Moore, April 2, 1823, <i>Letters</i>, 1901, vi. 179). It was no
wonder that so poignant, so persistent a calamity should be "reproduced
in his poetry" (<i>Life</i>, p. 13), or that his passionate impatience of
such a "thorn in the flesh" should picture to itself a mysterious and
unhallowed miracle of healing. It is true, as Moore says (<i>Life</i>, pp.
45, 306), that "the trifling deformity of his foot" was the embittering
circumstance of his life, that it "haunted him like a curse;" but it by
no means follows that he seriously regarded his physical peculiarity as
a stamp of the Divine reprobation, that "he was possessed by an <i>id&eacute;e
fixe</i> that every blessing would be 'turned into a curse' to him" (letter
of Lady Byron to H. C. Robinson, <i>Diary, etc.</i>, 1869, in. 435, 436). No
doubt he indulged himself in morbid fancies, played with the
extravagances of a restless imagination, and wedded them to verse; but
his intellect, "brooding like the day, a master o'er a slave," kept
guard. He would never have pleaded on his own behalf that the tyranny of
an <i>id&eacute;e fixe</i>, a delusion that he was predestined to evil, was an
excuse for his short-comings or his sins.</p>

<p>Byron's very considerable obligations to <i>The Three Brothers</i> might have
escaped notice, but the resemblance between his "Stranger," or "C&aelig;sar,"
and the Mephistopheles of "the great Goethe" was open and palpable.</p>

<p>If Medwin may be trusted (<i>Conversations</i>, 1824, p. 210), Byron had read
"<i>Faust</i> in a sorry French translation," and it is probable that
Shelley's inspired rendering of "May-day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span> Night," which was published in
<i>The Liberal</i> (No. i., October 14, 1822, pp. 123-137), had been read to
him, and had attracted his attention. <i>The Deformed Transformed</i> is "a
<i>Faustish</i> kind of drama;" and Goethe, who maintained that Byron's play
as a whole was "no imitation," but "new and original, close, genuine,
and spirited," could not fail to perceive that "his devil was suggested
by my Mephistopheles" (<i>Conversations</i>, 1874, p. 174). The tempter who
cannot resist the temptation of sneering at his own wiles, who mocks for
mocking's sake, is not Byron's creation, but Goethe's. Lucifer talked
<i>at</i> the clergy, if he did not "talk like a clergyman;" but the "bitter
hunchback," even when he is <i>solus</i>, sneers as the river wanders, "at
his own sweet will." He is not a doctor, but a spirit of unbelief!</p>

<p>The second part of <i>The Deformed Transformed</i> represents, in three
scenes, the Siege and Sack of Rome in 1527. Byron had read Robertson's
<i>Charles the Fifth</i> (ed. 1798, ii. 313-329) in his boyhood (<i>Life</i>, p.
47), but it is on record that he had studied, more or less closely, the
narratives of contemporary authorities. A note to <i>The Prophecy of
Dante</i> (<i>Poetical Works</i>, 1901, iv. 258) refers to the <i>Sacco di Roma</i>,
descritto da Luigi Guicciardini, and the <i>Ragguaglio Storico ... sacco
di Roma dell' anno</i> MDXXVII. of Jacopo Buonaparte; and it is evident
that he was familiar with Cellini's story of the marvellous gests and
exploits <i>quorum maxima pars fuit</i>, which were wrought at "the walls by
the Campo Santo," or on the ramparts of the Castle of San Angelo.</p>

<p>The Sack of Rome was a great national calamity, and it was something
more: it was a profanation and a sacrilege. The literature which it
evoked was a cry of anguish, a prophetic burden of despair. "Chants
populaires," writes M. Emile Gebhart (<i>De l'Italie</i>, "Le Sac de Rome en
1527," 1876, pp. 267, <i>sq.</i>), "<i>Nouvelles</i> de Giraldi Cintio, en forme
de D&eacute;cam&eacute;ron ... r&eacute;cits historiques ... de C&eacute;sar Grollier, <i>Dialogues</i>
anonymes ... po&eacute;sies de Pasquin, toute une litt&eacute;rature se developpa sur
ce th&egrave;me douloureux.... Le <i>Lamento di Roma</i>, &#339;uvre &eacute;trange,
d'inspiration gibeline, rappelle les esp&eacute;rances politiques exprim&eacute;es
jadis par Dante ... 'Bien que C&eacute;sar m'ait d&eacute;pouille'e de libert&eacute;, nous
avons toujours &eacute;t&eacute; d'accord dans une m&ecirc;me volont&eacute;. Je ne me lamenterais
pas si lui r&eacute;gnait; mais je crois qu'il est ressuscit&eacute;, ou qu'il
ressuscitera v&eacute;ritablement, car souvent un Ange m'a annonc&eacute; qu'un C&eacute;sar
viendrait me d&eacute;livrer.'... Enfin, voici une chanson fran&ccedil;aise que
r&eacute;p&eacute;taient en repassant les monts les soldats du Marquis de Saluces:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>O fils, n'en faictz reffus.'"</p>
</div></div>
<p>"Le dernier monument," adds M. Gebhart, in a footnote, "de cette
litt&eacute;rature, est le singulier drame de Byron, <i>The Deformed
Transformed</i>, dont Jules C&eacute;sar est le h&eacute;ros, et le Sac de Rome le
cadre."</p>

<p>It is unlikely that Byron, who read everything he could lay his hands
upon, and spared no trouble to master his "period," had not, either at
first or second hand, acquainted himself with specimens of this popular
literature. (For <i>La Presa e Lamento di Roma</i>, <i>Rom&aelig; Lamentatio</i>, etc.,
see <i>Lamenti Storici dei Secoli xiv., xv</i>. (Medin e Fratri), <i>Scelta di
Curiosit&agrave;</i>, etc., 235, 236, 237, Bologna, 1890, vol. iii. See, too, for
"Chanson sur la Mort du Conn&eacute;table de Bourbon," <i>Recueil de Chants
historiques fran&ccedil;ais</i>, par A. J. V. Le Roux de Lincy, 1842, ii. 99.)</p>

<p><i>The Deformed Transformed</i> was published by John Hunt, February 20,
1824. A third edition appeared February 23, 1824.</p>

<p>It was reviewed, unfavourably, in the <i>London Magazine</i>, March, 1824,
vol. 9, pp. 315-321; the <i>Scots Magazine</i>, March, 1824, N.S. vol. xiv.
pp. 353-356; and in the <i>Monthly Review</i>, March, 1824, Enlarged Series,
103, pp. 321, 324. One reviewer, however (<i>London Magazine</i>), had the
candour to admit that "Lord Byron may write below himself, but he can
never write below us!"</p>

was published in 1803. There is no copy of <i>The Three Brothers</i> in the
British Museum. The following extracts are taken from a copy in the
Bodleian Library at Oxford (vol. 4, cap. xi. pp. 229-350):&mdash;
</p><p>
"Arnaud, the natural son of the Marquis de Souvricour, was a child
'extraordinary in Beauty and Intellect.' When travelling with his
parents to Languedoc, Arnaud being 8 years old, he was shot at by
banditti, and forsaken by his parents. The Captain of the band nursed
him. 'But those perfections to which Arnaud owed his existence, ceased
to adorn it. The ball had gored his shoulder, and the fall had
dislocated it; by the latter misadventure his spine likewise was so
fatally injured as to be irrecoverable to its pristine uprightness.
Injuries so compound confounded the Captain, who sorrowed to see a
creature so charming, at once deformed by a crooked back and an
excrescent shoulder.' Arnaud was found and taken back to his parents.
'The bitterest consciousness of his deformity was derived from their
indelicate, though, perhaps, insensible alteration of conduct.... Of his
person he continued to speak as of an abhorrent enemy.... "Were a
blessing submitted to my choice, I would say, [said Arnaud] be it my
immediate dissolution." "I think," said his mother, ... "that you could
wish better." "Yes," adjoined Arnaud, "for that wish should be that I
ever had remained unborn."' He polishes the broken blade of a sword, and
views himself therein; the sight so horrifies him that he determines to
throw himself over a precipice, but draws back at the last moment. He
goes to a cavern, and conjures up the prince of hell. "Arnaud knew
himself to be interrogated. What he required.... What was that answer
the effects explain.... There passed in liveliest portraiture the
various men distinguished for that beauty and grace which Arnaud so much
desired, that he was ambitious to purchase them with his soul. He felt
that it was his part to chuse whom he would resemble, yet he remained
unresolved, though the spectator of an hundred shades of renown, among
which glided by Alexander, Alcibiades, and Hephestion: at length
appeared the supernatural effigy of a man, whose perfections human
artist never could depict or insculp&mdash;Demetrius, the son of Antigonus.
Arnaud's heart heaved quick with preference, and strait he found within
his hand the resemblance of a poniard, its point inverted towards his
breast. A mere automaton in the hands of the Demon, he thrust the point
through his heart, and underwent a painless death. During his trance,
his spirit metempsychosed from the body of his detestation to that of
his admiration ... Arnaud awoke a Julian!'"]</p></div>

fly-leaf of her copy of <i>The Deformed Transformed</i>:&mdash;
</p><p>
"This had long been a favourite subject with Lord Byron. I think that he
mentioned it also in Switzerland. I copied it&mdash;he sending a portion of
it at a time, as it was finished, to me. At this time he had a great
horror of its being said that he plagiarised, or that he studied for
ideas, and wrote with difficulty. Thus he gave Shelley Aikins' edition
of the British poets, that it might not be found in his house by some
English lounger, and reported home; thus, too, he always dated when he
began and when he ended a poem, to prove hereafter how quickly it was
done. I do not think that he altered a line in this drama after he had
once written it down. He composed and corrected in his mind. I do not
know how he meant to finish it; but he said himself that the whole
conduct of the story was already conceived. It was at this time that a
brutal paragraph<a href="#inner_F">[*]</a> alluding to his lameness appeared, which he repeated
to me lest I should hear it from some one else. No action of Lord
Byron's life&mdash;scarce a line he has written&mdash;but was influenced by his
personal defect."]
</p><p>
[<a name="inner_F" id="inner_F"></a>[*] It is possible that Mrs. Shelley alludes to a sentence in the
<i>Memoirs, etc., of Lord Byron</i>. (by Dr. John Watkin), 1822, p. 46: "A
malformation of one of his feet, and other indications of a rickety
constitution, served as a plea for suffering him to range the hills and
to wander about at his pleasure on the seashore, that his frame might be
invigorated by air and exercise."]</p></div>

with a passage in Byron's "Memoranda," where, in speaking of his own
sensitiveness on the subject of his deformed foot, he described the
feeling of horror and humiliation that came over him, when his mother,
in one of her fits of passion, called him "<i>a lame brat!</i>"... "It may
be questioned," he adds, "whether that whole drama [<i>The Deformed
Transformed</i>] was not indebted for its origin to that single
recollection."

Byron's early letters (<i>e.g.</i> November 2, 11, 17, 1804, <i>Letters</i>, 1898,
i. 41, 45, 48) are full of complaints of his mother's "eccentric
behaviour," her "fits of phrenzy," her "caprices," "passions," and so
forth; and there is convincing proof&mdash;see <i>Life</i>, pp. 28, 306;
<i>Letters</i>, 1898, ii. 122 (incident at Bellingham's execution);
<i>Letters</i>, 1901, vi. 179 (<i>Le Diable Boiteux</i>)&mdash;that he regarded the
contraction of the muscles of his legs as a more or less repulsive
deformity. And yet, to quote one of a hundred testimonies,&mdash;"with regard
to Lord Byron's features, Mr. Mathews observed, that he was the only man
he ever contemplated, to whom he felt disposed to apply the word
<i>beautiful</i>" (<i>Memoirs of Charles Matthews</i>, 1838, ii. 380). The
looker-on or the consoler computes the magnitude and the liberality of
the compensation. The sufferer thinks only of his sufferings.]</p></div>

when his father, Antigonus, had been told that he was indisposed, "he

took hold of his hand. 'My fever,' said Demetrius, 'has left me.' 'I

Marche, Dauphin d'Auvergne, was born February 17, 1490. He served in
Italy with Bayard, and helped to decide the victory of Agnadello (A.D.
1510). He was appointed Constable of France by Francis I., January,
1515, and fought at the battle of Marignano, September 13, 1515. Not
long afterwards he lost the king's favour, who was set against him by
his mother, Louise de Savoie; was recalled from his command in Italy,
and superseded by Odet de Foix, brother of the king's mistress. It was
not, however, till he became a widower (Susanne, Duchesse de Bourbon,
died April 28, 1521) that he finally broke with Francis and attached
himself to the Emperor Charles V. <i>Madame</i>, the king's mother, not only
coveted the vast estates of the house of Bourbon, but was enamoured of
the Constable's person, and, so to speak, gave him his choice between
marriage and a suit for his fiefs. Charles would have nothing to say to
the lady's proposals or to her son's entreaties, and seeing that
rejection meant ruin, he "entered into a correspondence with the
Emperor and the King [Henry VIII.] of England ... and, finding this
discovered, went into the Emperor's service."
</p><p>
After various and varying successes, both in the South of France and in
Lombardy, he found himself, in the spring of 1527, not so much the
commander-in-chief as the popular <i>capo</i> of a mixed body of German,
Spanish, and Italian <i>condottieri</i>, unpaid and ill-disciplined, who had
mutinied more than once, who could only be kept together by the prospect
of unlimited booty, and a timely concession to their demands. "To Rome!
to Rome!" cried the hungry and tumultuous <i>landsknechts</i>, and on May 5,
1527, the "late Constable of France," at the head of an army of 30,000
troops, appeared before the walls of the sacred city. On the morning of
the 6th of May, he was killed by a shot from an arquebuse. His epitaph
recounts his honours: "Aucto Imperio, Gallo victo, Superat&acirc; Itali&acirc;,
Pontifice obsesso, Rom&acirc; capt&acirc;, Borbonius, Hic Jacet;" but in Paris they
painted the sill of his gate-way yellow, because he was a renegade and a
traitor. He could not have said, with the dying Bayard, "Ne me plaignez
pas-je meurs sans avoir servi contre <i>ma patrie, mon roy</i>, et mon
serment." (See <i>Modern Universal History</i>, 1760, xxiv. 150-152, Note C;

led against Rome were at least six thousand Landsknechts, ardent
converts to the Reformed religion, and eager to prove their zeal by the
slaughter of Catholics and the destruction of altars and crucifixes.
Their leader, George Frundsberg, had set out for Rome with the pious
intention of hanging the Pope (see <i>The Popes of Rome</i>, by Leopold
Ranke, translated by Sarah Austen, 1866, i. 72). Brant&ocirc;me (<i>Memoirs de
Messire Pierre de Bourdeille</i>.... Leyde, 1722, i. 230) gives a vivid
picture of their fanatical savagery: "Leur cruaut&eacute; ne s'estendit pas
seulement sur les personnes, mais sur les marbres et les anciennes
statu&euml;s. Les Lansquenets, qui nouvellement estoient imbus de la nouvelle
Religion, et les Espagnols encore aussi bien que les autres,
s'habilloient en Cardinaux et evesques en leur habits Pontificaux et se
pourmenoient ainsi parray la Ville."
</p><p>
In the Schmalkald articles, 1530, the pious belief that the Pope was
Antichrist became an article of the Lutheran creed. Compare the
following extracts, quoted by Hans Schultz in <i>Der Sacco di Roma</i>, 1894,
p. 63, from the <i>Historia von der Romischen Bischoff, etc.</i>, 1527:
</p><p>
"Der Papst ist f&uuml;r den Verfasser der Antichrist, der durch Lug und Trug

INTRODUCTION TO <i>THE AGE OF BRONZE</i>.
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>


<p><i><span class="smcap">The</span> Age of Bronze</i> was begun in December, 1822, and finished on January
10, 1823. "I have sent," he writes (letter to Leigh Hunt, <i>Letters</i>,
1901, vi. 160), "to Mrs. S[helley], for the benefit of being copied, a
poem of about seven hundred and fifty lines length&mdash;The Age of
Bronze,&mdash;or <i>Carmen Seculare et Annus haud Mirabilis</i>, with this
Epigraph&mdash;'Impar <i>Congressus</i> Achilli.' It is calculated for the reading
part of the million, being all on politics, etc., etc., etc., and a
review of the day in general,&mdash;in my early <i>English Bards</i> style, but a
little more stilted, and somewhat too full of 'epithets of war' and
classical and historical allusions. If notes are necessary, they can be
added."</p>

<p>On March 5th he forwarded the "Proof in Slips" ("and certainly the
<i>Slips</i> are the most conspicuous part of it") to his new publisher, John
Hunt; and, on April 1, 1823, <i>The Age of Bronze</i> was published, but not
with the author's name.</p>

<p>Ten years had gone by since he had published, only to disclaim, the
latest of his boyish satires, <i>The Waltz</i>, and more than six years since
he had written, "at the request of Douglas Kinnaird," the stilted and
laboured <i>Monody on the Death of ... Sheridan</i>. In the interval
(1816-1822) he had essayed any and every measure but the heroic, and, at
length, as a tardy recognition of his allegiance to "the great moral
poet of all times, of all climes, of all feelings, and of all stages of
existence" (<i>Observations upon "Observations,"</i> <i>Letters</i>, 1901, v.
590), he reverts, as he believes, to his "early <i>English Bards</i> style,"
the style of Pope.</p>

<p>The brazen age, the "Annus Haud Mirabilis," which the satirist would
hold up to scorn, was 1822, the year after Napoleon's death, which
witnessed a revolution in Spain, and the Congress of Allied Sovereigns
at Verona. Earlier in the year, the publication of Las Cases' <i>Memorial
de S<span class="sup">te</span> H&eacute;l&egrave;ne</i>, and of O'Meara's <i>Napoleon in Exile, or a Voice from
St. Helena</i>, had created a sensation on both sides of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span> the Channel.
Public opinion had differed as to the system on which Napoleon should be
treated&mdash;and, since his death, there had been a conflict of evidence as
to the manner in which he had been treated, at St. Helena. Tories
believed that an almost excessive lenience and indulgence had been
wasted on a graceless and thankless intriguer, while the "Opposition,"
Liberals or Radicals, were moved to indignation at the hardships and
restrictions which were ruthlessly and needlessly imposed on a fallen
and powerless foe. It was, and is, a very pretty quarrel; and Byron,
whose lifelong admiration for his "H&eacute;ros de Roman" was tempered by
reason, approached the Longwood controversy somewhat in the spirit of a
partisan.</p>

<p>In <i>The Age of Bronze</i> (sects, iii.-v.) he touches on certain incidents
of the "Last Phase" of Napoleon's career, and proceeds to recapitulate,
in a sort of <i>Memoria Technica</i>, the chief events of his history, from
the dawn at Marengo to the sunset at "bloody and most bootless
Waterloo," and draws the unimpeachable moral that "Honesty is the best
policy," even when the "game is Empire" and "the stakes are thrones"!</p>

<p>From the rise and fall, the tyranny and captivity of Napoleon, he passes
on to the Congress of Allied Powers, which met at Verona in November,
1822.</p>

<p>The "Congress" is the object of his satire. It had assembled with a
parade of power and magnificence, and had dispersed with little or
nothing accomplished. It was "impar Achilli" (<i>vide ante</i>, <a href="#Note_535">p. 535,
note 1</a>), an empty menace, ill-matched with the revolutionary spirit,
and in pitiful contrast to the <i>Sic volo, sic jubeo</i> of the dead
Napoleon.</p>

<p>The immediate and efficient cause of the Congress of Verona was the
success of the revolution in Spain. The point at issue between Spanish
Liberals and Royalists, or <i>serviles</i>, was the adherence to, or the
evasion of, the democratic Constitution of 1812. At the moment the
Liberals were in the ascendant, and, as Chateaubriand puts it, had
driven King Ferdinand into captivity, at Urgel, in Catalonia, to the
tune of the Spanish Marseillaise, "<i>Tragala, Tragala</i>" "swallow it,
swallow it," that is, "accept the Constitution." On July 7, 1822, a
government was established under the name of the "Supreme Regency of
Spain during the Captivity of the King," and, hence, the consternation
of the partners of the Holy Alliance, especially France, who conceived,
or feigned to conceive, that revolution next door was a source of danger
to constitutional government at home. To meet the emergency, a Congress
was summoned in the first instance at Vienna, and afterwards at Verona.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
Thither came the sovereigns of Europe, great and small, accompanied by
their chancellors and ministers. The Czar Alexander was attended by
Count Nesselrode and Count Pozzo di Borgo; the Emperor Francis of
Austria, by Metternich and Prince Esterhazy; the King of Prussia
(Frederic William III.), by Count Bernstorff and Baron Humboldt. George
IV. of Great Britain, and Louis XVIII. of France, being elderly and
gouty, sent as their plenipotentiaries the Duke of Wellington and the
Vicomte de Montmorenci, accompanied, and, finally, superseded by, the
French ambassador, M. de Chateaubriand. Thither, too, came the smaller
fry, Kings of the Two Sicilies and of Sardinia; and last, but not least,
Marie Louise of Austria, Archduchess of Parma, <i>ci-devant</i> widow of
Napoleon, and wife <i>sub ros&acirc;</i> of her one-eyed chamberlain, Count de
Neipperg. They met, they debated, they went to the theatre in state, and
finally decided to send monitory despatches to Spain, and to leave to
France a free hand to look after her own interests, and to go to war or
not, as she was pleased to determine. There was one dissentient, the
Duke of Wellington, who refused to sign the <i>proc&egrave;s verbaux</i>. His
Britannic Majesty had been advised to let the Spaniards alone, and not
to meddle with their internal affairs. The final outcome of the
Congress, the French invasion of Spain, could not be foreseen; and,
apparently, all that the Congress had accomplished was to refuse to
prohibit the exportation of negroes from Africa to America, and to
decline to receive the Greek deputies.</p>

<p>As the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> (November 7, 1822) was pleased to put it,
"the Royal vultures have been deprived of their anticipated meal."</p>

<p>From the Holy Alliance and its antagonist, "the revolutionary stork,"
Byron turns to the landed and agricultural "interest" of Great Britain.
With the cessation of war and the resumption of cash payments in 1819,
prices had fallen some 50 per cent., and rents were beginning to fall.
Wheat, which in 1818 had fetched 80s. a quarter, in December, 1822, was
quoted at 39s. 11d.; consols were at 80. Poor rates had risen from
&pound;2,000,000 in 1792 to &pound;8,000,000 in 1822. How was the distress which
these changes involved to be met? By retrenchment and reform, by the
repeal of taxes, the reduction of salaries, by the landlords and
farmers, who had profited by war prices, submitting to the inevitable
reaction; or by sliding scales, by a return to an inflated currency,
perhaps by a repudiation of a portion of the funded debt?</p>

<p>The point of Byron's diatribe is that Squire Dives had enjoyed good
things during the war, and, now that the war was over, he had no
intention to let Lazarus have his turn;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span> that, whoever suffered, it
should not be Dives; that patriotism had brought grist to his mill; and
that he proposed to suck no small advantage out of peace.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Year after year they voted cent. per cent.,</p>
<p>Blood, sweat, and tear-wrung millions&mdash;why? for rent?</p>
<p>They roared, they dined, they drank, they swore they meant</p>
<p>To die for England&mdash;why then live?&mdash;for rent!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is easier to divine the "Sources" and the inspiration of <i>The Age of
Bronze</i> than to place the reader <i>au courant</i> with the literary and
political <i>causerie</i> of the day. Byron wrote with O'Meara's book at his
elbow, and with batches of <i>Galignani's Messenger</i>, the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i>, and <i>Cobbett's Weekly Register</i> within his reach. He was
under the impression that his lines would appear as an anonymous
contribution to <i>The Liberal</i>, and, in any case, he felt that he could
speak out, unchecked and uncriticized by friend or publisher. He was, so
to speak, unmuzzled.</p>

<p>With regard to the style and quality of his new satire, Byron was under
an amiable delusion. His couplets, he imagined, were in his "early
<i>English Bards</i> style," but "more stilted." He did not realize that,
whatever the intervening years had taken away, they had "left behind"
experience and passion, and that he had learned to think and to feel.
The fault of the poem is that too much matter is packed into too small a
compass, and that, in parts, every line implies a minute acquaintance
with contemporary events, and requires an explanatory note. But, even
so, in <i>The Age of Bronze</i> Byron has wedded "a striking passage of
history" to striking and imperishable verse.</p>

<p><i>The Age of Bronze</i> was reviewed in the <i>Scots Magazine</i>, April, 1823,
N.S., vol. xii. pp. 483-488; the <i>Monthly Review</i>, April, 1823, E.S.,
vol. 100, pp. 430-433; the <i>Monthly Magazine</i>, May, 1823, vol. 55, pp.
322-325; the <i>Examiner</i>, March 30, 1823; the <i>Literary Chronicle</i>, April
5, 1823; and the <i>Literary Gazette</i>, April 5, 1823.</p>

1127), Ptolem&aelig;us Soter brought Alexander's body back from Babylon, and
buried it in Alexandria, in the spot afterwards known as the <i>Soma</i>.
There it lay, in Strabo's time, not in its original body-mask of golden
chase-work, which Ptolem&aelig;us Cocces had stolen, but in a casket of
glass. Great men "turned to pilgrims" to visit Alexander's grave.
Augustus crowned the still life-like body with a golden laurel-wreath,
and scattered flowers over the tomb: Caligula stole the breastplate, and
wore it during his pantomimic triumphs; Septimius Severus buried in the
sarcophagus the writings of the priests, and a clue to the
hieroglyphics. Finally, the sarcophagus and its sacred remains
disappear, and Alexander himself passes into the land of fable and
romance. In 1801 a sarcophagus came into the possession of the English
Army, and was presented by George III. to the British Museum.
Hieroglyphics were as yet undeciphered, and, in 1805, the traveller
Edward Daniel Clarke published a quarto monograph (<i>The Tomb of
Alexander, etc.</i>), in which he proves, to his own satisfaction, that
"this surprising sarcophagus in one entire block of green Egyptian
<i>breccia</i>," had once contained the ashes of Alexander the Great. Byron
knew Clarke, and, no doubt, respected his authority (see letter December
15, 1813, <i>Letters</i>, 1898, ii. 308); and, hence, the description of
"Alexander's urn" as "a show." The sarcophagus which has, since 1844,
been assigned to its rightful occupant, Nectanebus II. (Nekht-neb-f), is
a conspicuous object in the Egyptian Gallery of the British Museum. It
is a curious coincidence that in the Ethiopic version of the
Pseudo-Callisthenes, Alexander is said to have been the son of
Nectanebus II., who threw a spell over Olympias, the wife of Philip of
Macedon, and won her love by the exercise of nefarious magic. (See the
<i>Life and Exploits of Alexander the Great</i>, by E. A. Wallis Budge,
Litt.D., F.S.A., Keeper of the Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities in the
British Museum, 1896, i, ix.)]</p></div>

had acquired; "that if he had annexed Europe to Asia, and the British
Isles to Europe, he would have sought out some no-man's-land to
conquer." So insatiable was his ambition, that when the courtly
philosopher Anaxarchus explained to him the theory of the plurality of
worlds he bemoaned himself because as yet he was not master of one.

September 7, 13, etc. (see <i>Napoleon in Exile</i>, 1888, i. 95, 96, 114,
121, etc.), reports complaints on the part of Napoleon with regard to
the reduction of expenses suggested or enforced by Sir Hudson Lowe, and
gives specimens of the nature and detail of these reductions. For a
refutation of O'Meara's facts and figures (as given in <i>Napoleon in
Exile</i>, 1822, ii. Appendix V.), see the <i>History of the Captivity of
Napoleon</i>, by William Forsyth, Q.C., 1853, iii. 121, <i>sq</i>.; see, too,
<i>Sir Hudson Lowe and Napoleon</i>, by R. C. Seaton, 1898. It is a fact that
Sir Hudson Lowe, on his own responsibility, increased the allowance for
the household expenses of Napoleon and his staff from &pound;8000 to &pound;12,000 a
year, and it is also perfectly true that opportunities for complaint
were welcomed by the ex-Emperor and his mimic court. It was <i>la
politique de Longwood</i> to make the worst of everything, on the
off-chance that England would get to hear, and that Radical indignation
and Radical sympathy would gild, perhaps unbar, the eagle's cage. It is
true, too, that a large sum of money was spent on behalf of a prisoner
of war whom the stalwarts of the Tory party would have executed in cold
blood. But it is also true that Napoleon had no need to manufacture
complaints, that he was exposed to unnecessary discomforts, that useless
and irritating precautions were taken to prevent his escape, that the
bottles of champagne and madeira, the fowls and the bundles of wood were
counted with an irritating preciseness, inconsistent with the general
scale of expenditure, which saved a little waste, and covered both
principals and agents with ridicule. It is said that O'Meara, in his
published volumes, manipulated his evidence, and that his own letters
give him the lie; but there is a mass of correspondence, published and
unpublished, between him and Sir Thomas Reade, Sir Hudson Lowe, and
Major Gorrequer (see Addit. MSS. Brit. Mus. 20,145), which remains as it
was written, and which testifies to facts which might have been and were
not refuted on the spot and at the moment. With regard to "disputed
rations," the Governor should have been armed with a crushing answer to
any and every complaint. As it was, he was able to show that champagne
was allowed to "Napoleon Buonaparte," and that he did not exceed his
allowance.]</p></div>

was the son of an army surgeon, John Hudson Lowe. His mother was Irish.
He was appointed Governor of St. Helena, August 23, 1815, and landed in
the island April 14, 1816. Byron met him at Lord Holland's, before he
sailed for St. Helena, and was not impressed by his remarks on Napoleon
and Waterloo (<i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 429). He was well-intentioned,
honourable, and, in essentials, humane, but he was arrogant and
tactless. The following sentence, from a letter written by Lowe to
O'Meara, October 3, 1816 (Forsyth, i. 318, 319), is characteristic:
"With respect to the instructions I have received, and my manner of
making them known, never having regarded General Bonaparte's opinions in
any point whatever as to <i>matter</i> or <i>manner</i>, as an oracle or criterion
by which to regulate my own judgment, I am not disposed to think the
less favourably of the instructions, or my mode of executing them." It
must, however, be borne in mind that this was written some time after
Lowe's fifth and last interview with his captive (Aug. 18, 1816); that
Napoleon had abused him to his face and behind his back, and was not
above resorting to paltry subterfuges in order to defy and exasperate
his "paltry gaoler."]</p></div>

assistant-surgeon to the 62nd Regiment, then stationed in Sicily and
Calabria. In 1815 he was surgeon on board the <i>Bellerophon</i>, under
Captain F. L. Maitland. Napoleon took a fancy to him because he could
speak Italian, and, as his own surgeon Mengeaud would not follow him
into exile, requested that O'Meara might accompany him, in the
<i>Northumberland</i>, to St. Helena. His position was an ambiguous one. He
was to act as Napoleon's medical and, <i>quoad hoc</i>, confidential
attendant, but he was not to be subservient to him or dependent on him.
At St. Helena Lowe expected him to be something between an intermediary
and a spy, and, for a time, O'Meara discharged both functions to the
Governor's satisfaction (statements by Dr. O'Meara are quoted by Lowe in
his letter to Lord Bathurst [<i>Life of Napoleon, etc.</i>, by Sir W. Scott,
1828, p. 763]). As time went on, the surgeon yielded to the glamour of
Napoleon's influence, and more and more disliked and resented the
necessity of communicating private conversations to Lowe. He "withheld
his confidence," with the result that the Governor became suspicious,
and treated O'Meara with reprobation and contempt. At length, on July
18, 1818, on a renewed accusation of "irregularities," Lord Bathurst
dismissed him from his post, and ordered him to quit St. Helena. He
returned to England, and, October 28, 1818, addressed a letter (see
Forsyth's <i>Napoleon, etc.</i>, iii. 432, 433) to J. W. Croker, the Secretary
to the Admiralty, in which he argued against the justice of his
dismissal. One sentence which asserted that Lowe had dwelt upon the
"benefit which would result to Europe from the death of Napoleon," was
seized upon by Croker as calumnious, and in answer to his remonstrance,
O'Meara's name was struck off the list of naval surgeons. He published,
in 1819, a work entitled <i>Exposition of some of the Transactions that
have taken place at St. Helena since the appointment of Sir Hudson Lowe
as Governor</i>, which was afterwards expanded into <i>Napoleon in Exile, or
a Voice from St. Helena</i> (2 vols., 1822). The latter work made a great
sensation, and passed through five editions. It was republished in 1888.
O'Meara was able, and generously disposed, but he was not "stiff" (<i>vide
infra</i>, 489). "He was," says Lord Rosebery (<i>Napoleon, The Last Phase</i>,
1900, p. 31), "the confidential servant of Napoleon: unknown to
Napoleon, he was the confidential agent of Lowe; and behind both their
backs he was the confidential informant of the British Government....
Testimony from such a source is ... tainted." Neither men nor angels
will disentangle the wheat from the tares.]</p></div>

[John of Trocnow, surnamed Zi&#382;ka, or the "One-eyed,"
was born circ. 1360, and died while he was besieging a town on the
Moravian border, October 11, 1424. He was the hero of the Hussite or
Taborite crusade (1419-1422), the <i>malleus Catholicorum</i>. The story is
that on his death-bed he was asked where he wished to be buried, and
replied, "that it mattered not, that his flesh might be thrown to the
vulture and eagles; but his skin was to be carefully preserved and made
into a drum, to be carried in the front of the battle, that the very
sound might disperse their enemies." Voltaire, in his <i>Essai sur Les
M&#339;urs et L'Esprit des Nations</i> (cap. lxxiii. s.f. <i>&#338;uvres Compl&egrave;tes,

one of the leading spirits of the American Revolution. His father, John
Henry, a Scotchman, a cousin of the historian, William Robertson, had
acquired a small property in Virginia. Patrick was not exactly "forest
born," but, as a child, loved to play truant "in the forest with his gun
or over his angle-rod." He first came into notice as an orator in the
"Parson's Cause," a suit brought by a minister of the Established Church
to recover his salary, which had been fixed at 16,000 lbs. of tobacco.
In his speech he is said to have struck the key-note of the Revolution
by arguing that "a king, by disallowing acts of a salutary nature, from
being the father of his people, degenerates into a tyrant, and forfeits
all right to his subjects' obedience." His famous speech against the
"Stamps Act" was delivered in the House of Burgesses of Virginia, May
29, 1765. One passage, with which, no doubt, Byron was familiar, has
passed into history. "C&aelig;sar had his Brutus&mdash;Charles the First had his
Cromwell&mdash;and George the Third&mdash;" Henry was interrupted with a shout of
"Treason! treason!!" but finished the sentence with, and "George the
Third <i>may profit by their example.</i> If <i>this</i> be treason, make the most
of it."
</p><p>
Henry was delegate to the first Continental Congress, five times
Governor of Virginia, and was appointed U.S. Senator in 1794.
</p><p>
His contemporaries said that he was "the greatest orator that ever
lived." He seems to have exercised a kind of magical influence over his
hearers, which they could not explain, which charmed and overwhelmed
them, and "has left behind a tradition of bewitching persuasiveness and
almost prophetic sublimity."&mdash;See <i>Life of Patrick Henry</i>, by William
Wirt, 1845, <i>passim.</i>]</p></div>

father in 1801. He began his reign well. Taxation was diminished,
judicial penalties were remitted, universities were founded and
reorganized, personal servitude was abolished or restricted throughout
the empire. At the height of his power and influence, when he was
regarded as the Liberator of Europe, he granted a Constitution to
Poland, based on liberal if not democratic principles (June 21, 1815).
But after a time he reverted to absolutism. Autocracy at home, a
mystical and sentimental alliance with autocrats abroad, were
incompatible with the indulgence of liberal proclivities. "After the
Congresses of Aix-la-Chapelle and Troppau," writes M. Rambaud (<i>History
of Russia</i>, 1888, ii. 384), "he was no longer the same man.... From that
time he considered himself the dupe of his generous ideas ... at
Carlsbad, at Laybach, and at Verona, Alexander was already the leader of
the European reaction." But even to the last he believed that he could
run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. "They may say of me," he
exclaimed, "what they will; but I have lived and shall die republican"
(ibid., p. 398).
</p><p>
Alexander was a man of ideas, a sentimentalist, and a <i>poseur</i>, but he
had an eye to the main chance. Whatever cause or dynasty suffered, the
Emperor Alexander was still triumphant. Byron's special grudge against
him at this time was due to his vacillation with regard to the cause of
Greek Independence. But he is too contemptuous. There were points in
common between the "Coxcomb Czar" and his satirist; and it is far from
certain that if the twain had changed places Byron might not have proved
just "such an Alexander." In one respect their destiny was alike. The
greatest sorrow of their lives was the death of a natural daughter.]</p></div>

he exclaimed, "Vous les r&eacute;presentez-vous payant d'une main le salaire du

were "violens murmures, cris d'indignation &agrave; droite." The duel, however,
did not arise out of a speech in the Chamber, but from a letter of June

several years of exile in England, at Goswell, Wanstead, and latterly at
Hartwell, near Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire. When he entered Paris as
king, in May, 1814, he was in his fifty-ninth year, inordinately bulky
and unwieldy&mdash;a king <i>pour rire</i>. "C'est ce gros goutteux," explained an
<i>ouvrier</i> to a bystander, who had asked, "Which is the king?" Fifteen
mutton cutlets, "saut&eacute;es au jus," for breakfast; fifteen mutton cutlets
served with a "sauce &agrave; la champagne," for dinner; to say nothing of
strawberries, and sweet apple-puffs between meals, made digestion and
locomotion difficult. It was no wonder that he was a martyr to the gout.
But he cared for nature and for books as well as for eating. His
<i>Lettres d'Artwell</i> (Paris, 1830), which profess to be selections from
his correspondence with a friend, give a pleasant picture of the <i>roi en
exil</i>. His wife, Louise de Savoie, died November, 1810, and in the
following April he writes (<i>Lettres</i>, pp. 70, 71), "Mars a maintenu le
bien d'un hiver fort doux; point encore de goutte; <i>&agrave; brebis tondue,
Dieu measure le vent</i>. H&eacute;las! je l'&eacute;prouve bien qu'elle est tondue cette

disaient: <i>Super flumina Babylonis ... Sion.</i> Mais ajoutons tout de
suite: <i>Si oblitus fuero hit, Jerusalem, oblivioni detur dextera mea</i>."
In another letter, June 8, 1811, he criticizes some translations of
Horace, and laments that the good P&egrave;re Sanadon has confined himself to
the <i>Opera Expurgata</i>. Not, he adds, that he would not have excluded one
or two odes, "mais on a impitoyablement sabr&eacute; des choses d&eacute;licieuses"
(<i>Lettres</i>, p. 98).

To his wit, Chateaubriand testifies (<i>The Congress, etc.</i>, 1838, i.
262). At the council, when affairs of state were being discussed, the
king "would say in his clear shrill voice, 'I am going to make you
laugh, M. de Chateaubriand.' The other ministers fumed with impatience,
but Chateaubriand laughed, not as a courtier, but as a human being."]</p></div>

INTRODUCTION TO <i>THE ISLAND</i>
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first canto of <i>The Island</i> was finished January 10, 1823. We know
that Byron was still at work on "the poeshie," January 25 (<i>Letters</i>,
1901, vi. 164), and may reasonably conjecture that a somewhat illegible
date affixed to the fourth canto, stands for February 14, 1823. The MS.
had been received in London before April 9 (<i>ibid</i>., p. 192); and on
June 26, 1823, <i>The Island; or, The Adventures of Christian and his
Comrades</i>, was published by John Hunt.</p>

<p>Byron's "Advertisement," or note, prefixed to <i>The Island</i> contains all
that need be said with regard to the "sources" of the poem.</p>

<p>Two separate works were consulted: (1) <i>A Narrative of the Mutiny on
board His Majesty's Ship Bounty, and the subsequent Voyage of ... the
Ship's Boat from Tafoa, one of the Friendly Islands, to Timor, a Dutch
Settlement in the East Indies</i>, written by Lieutenant William Bligh,
1790; and (2) <i>An Account of the Natives of the Tonga Islands</i>, Compiled
and Arranged from the Extensive Communications of Mr. William Mariner,
by John Martin, M.D., 1817.</p>

<p>According to George Clinton (<i>Life and Writings of Lord Byron</i>, 1824, p.
656), Byron was profoundly impressed by Mariner's report of the scenery
and folklore of the <i>Friendly Islands</i>, was "never tired of talking of
it to his friends," and, in order to turn this poetic material to
account, finally bethought him that Bligh's <i>Narrative</i> of the mutiny of
the <i>Bounty</i> would serve as a framework or structure "for an embroidery
of rare device"&mdash;the figures and foliage of a tropical pattern. That, at
least, is the substance of Clinton's analysis of the "sources" of <i>The
Island</i>, and whether he spoke, or only feigned to speak, with authority,
his criticism is sound and to the point. The story of the mutiny of the
<i>Bounty</i>, which is faithfully related in the first canto, is not, as the
second title implies, a prelude to the "Adventures of Christian and his
Comrades," but to a description of "The Island," an Ogygia of the South
Seas.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that Byron's acquaintance with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span> the details of
the mutiny of the <i>Bounty</i> was derived exclusively from Bligh's
<i>Narrative</i>; that he does not seem to have studied the minutes of the
court-martial on Peter Heywood and the other prisoners (September,
1792), or to have possessed the information that in 1809, and, again, in
1815, the Admiralty received authentic information with regard to the
final settlement of Christian and his comrades on Pitcairn Island.
Articles, however, had appeared in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, February,
1810, vol. iii. pp. 23, 24, and July, 1815, vol. xiii. pp. 376-378,
which contained an extract from the log-book of Captain Mayhew Folger,
of the American ship <i>Topaz</i>, dated September 29, 1808, and letters from
Folger (March 1, 1813), and Sir Thomas Staines, October 18, 1814, which
solved the mystery. Moreover, the article of February, 1810, is quoted
in the notes (pp. 313-318) affixed to Miss Mitford's <i>Christina, the
Maid of the South Seas</i>, 1811, a poem founded on Bligh's <i>Narrative</i>, of
which neither Byron or his reviewers seem to have heard.</p>

<p>But whatever may have been his opportunities of ascertaining the facts
of the case, it is certain (see his <a href="#Footnote_403">note to Canto IV. section vi. line
122</a>) that he did not know what became of Christian, and that whereas in
the first canto he follows the text of Bligh's <i>Narrative</i>, in the three
last cantos he draws upon his imagination, turning Tahiti into Toobonai
(Tubuai), and transporting Toobonai from one archipelago to
another&mdash;from the Society to the Friendly Islands.</p>

<p>Another and still more surprising feature of <i>The Island</i> is that Byron
accepts, without qualification or reserve, the guilt of the mutineers
and the innocence and worth of Lieutenant Bligh. It is true that by
inheritance he was imbued with the traditions of the service, and from
personal experience understood the necessity of discipline on board
ship; but it may be taken for granted that if he had known that the
sympathy, if not the esteem, of the public had been transferred from
Bligh to Christian, that in the opinion of grave and competent writers,
the guilt of mutiny on the high seas had been almost condoned by the
violence and brutality of the commanding officer, he would have sided
with the oppressed rather than the oppressor. As it is, he takes Bligh
at his own valuation, and carefully abstains from "eulogizing mutiny."
(Letter to L. Hunt, January 25, 1823.)</p>

<p>The story of the "mutiny of the <i>Bounty</i>" happened in this wise. In 1787
it occurred to certain West India planters and merchants, resident in
London, that it would benefit the natives, and perhaps themselves, if
the bread-fruit tree, which flourished in Tahiti (the Otaheite of
Captain Cook and Sir Joseph Banks, see <i>Poetical Works</i>, 1899, ii. 7,
note 2) and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span> other islands of the South Seas, could be acclimatized in
the West Indies. A petition was addressed to the king, with the result
that a vessel, with a burden of 215 tons, which Banks christened the
<i>Bounty</i>, sailed from Spithead December 23, 1787. Lieutenant William
Bligh, who had sailed with Cook in the <i>Resolution</i>, acted as commanding
officer, and under him were five midshipmen, a master, two master's
mates, etc.&mdash;forty-four persons all told. The <i>Bounty</i> arrived at Tahiti
October 26, 1788, and there for six delightful months the ship's company
tarried, "fleeting the time carelessly, as in the elder world." But
"Scripture saith an ending to all fine things must be," and on April 4,
1789, the <i>Bounty</i>, with a cargo of over a thousand bread-fruit trees,
planted in pots, tubs, and boxes (see for plate of the pots, etc., <i>A
Voyage, etc.</i>, 1792, p. 1), sailed away westward for the Cape of Good
Hope, and the West Indies. All went well at first, but "just before
sun-rising" on Tuesday, April 28, 1789, "the north-westernmost of the
Friendly Islands, called Tofoa, bearing north-east," Fletcher Christian,
who was mate of the watch, assisted by Charles Churchill,
master-at-arms, Alexander Smith (the John Adams of Pitcairn Island), and
Thomas Burkitt, able seamen, seized the captain, tied his hands behind
his back, hauled him out of his berth, and forced him on deck. The
boatswain, William Cole, was ordered to hoist out the ship's launch,
which measured twenty-three feet from stem to stern, and into this open
boat Bligh, together with eighteen of the crew, who were or were
supposed to be on his side, were thrust, on pain of instant death. When
they were in the boat they were "veered round with a rope, and finally
cast adrift." Bligh and his eighteen innocent companions sailed
westward, and, after a voyage of "twelve hundred leagues," during which
they were preserved from death and destruction by the wise ordering and
patient heroism of the commander, safely anchored in K&oelig;pang Bay, on the
north-west coast of the Isle of Timor, June 14, 1789. (See Bligh's
<i>Narrative, etc.</i>, 1790, pp. 11-88; and <i>The Island</i>, Canto I. section
ix. lines 169-201.)</p>

<p>The <i>Bounty</i>, with the remainder of the crew, twenty-five in number,
"the most able of the ship's company," sailed eastward, first to
Toobooai, or Tubuai, an island to the south of the Society Islands,
thence to Tahiti (June 6), back to Tubuai (June 26), and yet again, to
Tahiti (September 20), where sixteen of the mutineers, including the
midshipman George Stewart (the "Torquil" of <i>The Island</i>), were put on
shore. Finally, September 21, 1789, Fletcher Christian, with the
<i>Bounty</i> and eight of her crew, six Tahitian men, and twelve women,
sailed away still further east to unknown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span> shores, and, so it was
believed, disappeared for good and all. Long afterwards it was known
that they had landed on Pitcairn Island, broken up the <i>Bounty</i>, and
founded a permanent settlement.</p>

<p>When Bligh returned to England (March 14, 1790), and acquainted the
Government "with the atrocious act of piracy and mutiny" which had been
committed on the high seas, the <i>Pandora</i> frigate, with Captain Edwards,
was despatched to apprehend the mutineers, and bring them back to
England for trial and punishment. The <i>Pandora</i> reached Tahiti March 23,
1791, set sail, with fourteen prisoners, May 8, and was wrecked on the
"Great Barrier Reef" north-east of Queensland, August 29, 1791. Four of
the prisoners, including George Stewart, who had been manacled, and were
confined in "Pandora's box," perished in the wreck, and the remaining
ten were brought back to England, and tried by court-martial. (See <i>The
Eventful History of the Mutiny, etc.</i> (by Sir John Barrow), 1831, pp.
205-244.)</p>

<p>The story, which runs through the second, third, and fourth cantos, may
possibly owe some of its details to a vague recollection of incidents
which happened, or were supposed to happen, at Tahiti, in the interval
between the final departure of the <i>Bounty</i>, September 21, 1789, and the
arrival of the <i>Pandora</i>, March 23, 1791; but, as a whole, it is a work
of fiction.</p>

<p>With the exception of the fifteenth and sixteenth cantos of <i>Don Juan</i>,
<i>The Island</i> was the last poem of any importance which Byron lived to
write, and the question naturally suggests itself&mdash;Is the new song as
good as the old? Byron answers the question himself. He tells Leigh Hunt
(January 25, 1823) that he hopes the "poem will be a little above the
ordinary run of periodical poesy," and that, though portions of the
Toobonai (<i>sic</i>) islanders are "pamby," he intends "to scatter some
<i>un</i>common places here and there nevertheless." On the whole, in point
of conception and execution, <i>The Island</i> is weaker and less coherent
than the <i>Corsair</i>; but it contains lines and passages (<i>e.g.</i> Canto I.
lines 107-124, 133-140; Canto II. lines 272-297; Canto IV. lines 94-188)
which display a finer feeling and a more "exalted wit" than the "purple
patches" of <i>The Turkish Tales</i>.</p>

<p>The poetic faculty is somewhat exhausted, but the poetic vision has been
purged and heightened by suffering and self-knowledge.</p>

<p><i>The Island</i> was reviewed in the <i>Monthly Review</i>, July, 1823, E.S.,
vol. 101, pp. 316-319; the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i>, N.S., 1823, vol. 8,
pp. 136-141; the <i>Atlantic Magazine</i>, April, 1826, vol. 2, pp. 333-337;
in the <i>Literary Chronicle</i>, June 21, 1823; and the <i>Literary Gazette</i>,

<p>Aught from Experience, that chill touchstone, whose</p>

<p>Restore their surface, in itself so still,</p>

<p>Through the approaching darkness of the wood<span class="linenum">460</span></p>

<p>Such as appears to rise out from the deep,</p>
<p>When o'er the line the merry vessels sweep,</p>
<p>And the rough Saturnalia of the tar</p>

<p>Of his true sons, who riot in the breeze<span class="linenum">470</span></p>
<p>Undreamt of in his native Cyclades.</p>
<p>Still the old God delights, from out the main,</p>
<p>To snatch some glimpses of his ancient reign.</p>
<p>Our sailor's jacket, though in ragged trim,</p>
<p>His constant pipe, which never yet burned dim,</p>
<p>His foremast air, and somewhat rolling gait,</p>
<p>Like his dear vessel, spoke his former state;</p>
<p>But then a sort of kerchief round his head,</p>
<p>Not over tightly bound, nor nicely spread;</p>
<p>And, 'stead of trowsers (ah! too early torn!<span class="linenum">480</span></p>
<p>For even the mildest woods will have their thorn)</p>
<p>A curious sort of somewhat scanty mat</p>
<p>Now served for inexpressibles and hat;</p>
<p>His naked feet and neck, and sunburnt face,</p>
<p>Perchance might suit alike with either race.</p>
<p>His arms were all his own, our Europe's growth,</p>
<p>Which two worlds bless for civilising both;</p>
<p>The musket swung behind his shoulders broad,</p>
<p>And somewhat stooped by his marine abode,</p>
<p>But brawny as the boar's; and hung beneath,<span class="linenum">490</span></p>
<p>His cutlass drooped, unconscious of a sheath,</p>
<p>Or lost or worn away; his pistols were</p>
<p>Linked to his belt, a matrimonial pair&mdash;</p>
<p>(Let not this metaphor appear a scoff,</p>
<p>Though one missed fire, the other would go off);</p>
<p>These, with a bayonet, not so free from rust<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span></p>

<p>Stern, and aloof a little from the rest,</p>
<p>Stood Christian, with his arms across his chest.</p>
<p>The ruddy, reckless, dauntless hue once spread</p>
<p>Along his cheek was livid now as lead;</p>
<p>His light-brown locks, so graceful in their flow,</p>
<p>Now rose like startled vipers o'er his brow.<span class="linenum">90</span></p>
<p>Still as a statue, with his lips comprest</p>

<p>Which deepened now and then the sandy dint</p>
<p>Beneath his heel, his form seemed turned to flint.</p>
<p>Some paces further Torquil leaned his head</p>
<p>Against a bank, and spoke not, but he bled,&mdash;</p>
<p>Not mortally:&mdash;his worst wound was within;</p>
<p>His brow was pale, his blue eyes sunken in,<span class="linenum">100</span></p>
<p>And blood-drops, sprinkled o'er his yellow hair,</p>
<p>Showed that his faintness came not from despair,</p>
<p>But Nature's ebb. Beside him was another,</p>
<p>Rough as a bear, but willing as a brother,&mdash;</p>
<p>Ben Bunting, who essayed to wash, and wipe,</p>
<p>And bind his wound&mdash;then calmly lit his pipe,</p>
<p>A trophy which survived a hundred fights,</p>
<p>A beacon which had cheered ten thousand nights.</p>
<p>The fourth and last of this deserted group</p>
<p>Walked up and down&mdash;at times would stand, then stoop<span class="linenum">110</span></p>
<p>To pick a pebble up&mdash;then let it drop&mdash;</p>
<p>Then hurry as in haste&mdash;then quickly stop&mdash;</p>
<p>Then cast his eyes on his companions&mdash;then</p>
<p>Half whistle half a tune, and pause again&mdash;</p>
<p>And then his former movements would redouble,</p>
<p>With something between carelessness and trouble.</p>
<p>This is a long description, but applies</p>
<p>To scarce five minutes passed before the eyes;</p>
<p>But yet <i>what</i> minutes! Moments like to these</p>

<p>And now what refuge but their frail canoe?</p>
<p>This Torquil asked with half upbraiding eye,</p>

<p>They rested on their paddles, and uprose</p>
<p>Neuha, and pointing to the approaching foes,</p>

<p>There was no time to pause&mdash;the foes were near&mdash;</p>
<p>Chains in his eye, and menace in his ear;</p>
<p>With vigour they pulled on, and as they came,</p>
<p>Hailed him to yield, and by his forfeit name.</p>
<p>Headlong he leapt&mdash;to him the swimmer's skill</p>
<p>Was native, and now all his hope from ill:</p>
<p>But how, or where? He dived, and rose no more;</p>
<p>The boat's crew looked amazed o'er sea and shore.</p>
<p>There was no landing on that precipice,</p>
<p>Steep, harsh, and slippery as a berg of ice.<span class="linenum">70</span></p>
<p>They watched awhile to see him float again,</p>
<p>But not a trace rebubbled from the main:</p>
<p>The wave rolled on, no ripple on its face,</p>
<p>Since their first plunge recalled a single trace;</p>
<p>The little whirl which eddied, and slight foam,</p>
<p>That whitened o'er what seemed their latest home,</p>
<p>White as a sepulchre above the pair</p>
<p>Who left no marble (mournful as an heir)</p>
<p>The quiet Proa wavering o'er the tide</p>
<p>Was all that told of Torquil and his bride;<span class="linenum">80</span></p>
<p>And but for this alone the whole might seem</p>
<p>The vanished phantom of a seaman's dream.</p>
<p>They paused and searched in vain, then pulled away;</p>
<p>Even Superstition now forbade their stay.</p>
<p>Some said he had not plunged into the wave,</p>
<p>But vanished like a corpse-light from a grave;</p>
<p>Others, that something supernatural</p>
<p>Glared in his figure, more than mortal tall;</p>
<p>While all agreed that in his cheek and eye</p>
<p>There was a dead hue of Eternity.<span class="linenum">90</span></p>
<p>Still as their oars receded from the crag,</p>
<p>Round every weed a moment would they lag,</p>
<p>Expectant of some token of their prey;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_352" id="Footnote_352"></a><a href="#FNanchor_352"><span class="label">[352]</span></a> [William Bligh, the son of Cornish parents, was born
September 9 1754 (? 1753). He served under Cook in his second voyage in
the <i>Resolution</i>, 1772-75, as sailing-master; and, in 1782, fought under
Lord Howe at Gibraltar. He married a daughter of William Betham, first
collector of customs in the Isle of Man, and hence his connection with
Fletcher Christian, who belonged to a Manx family, and the midshipman
Peter Hayward, who was the son of a Deemster. He was appointed to the
<i>Bounty</i> in December, 1787, and in 1791 to the <i>Providence</i>, which was
despatched to the Society Islands to obtain a fresh cargo of bread-fruit
trees in place of those which were thrown overboard by the mutineers. He
commanded the <i>Glatton</i> at Copenhagen, May 21, 1801, and on that and
other occasions served with distinction. He was made Governor of New
South Wales in 1805, but was forcibly deposed in an insurrection headed
by Major Johnston, January, 1808. He was kept in prison till 1810, but
on his return to England his administration of his office was approved,
and Johnston was cashiered. He was advanced to the rank of Vice-Admiral
of the Blue in 1814, and died, December 7, 1817.
</p><p>
In his <i>Narrative</i> Bligh describes the mutiny as "a close-planned act of
villainy," and attributes the conspiracy not to his own harshness, or to
disloyalty provoked by "real or imaginary grievances," but to the
contrast of life on board ship, "in ever climbing up the climbing wave,"
with the unearned luxuries of Tahiti, "the allurements of dissipation
... the female connections," which the sailors had left behind. Besides
his own apology, there are the sworn statements of the two midshipmen,
Hayward and Hallet, and others, which Bligh published in answer to a
pamphlet which Edward Christian, afterwards Chief Justice of Ely, wrote
in defence of his brother Fletcher. The evidence against Bligh is
contained in the MS. journal of the boatswain's mate, James Morrison,
which was saved, as by a miracle, from the wreck of the <i>Pandora</i>, and
is quoted by Sir John Barrow, Lady Belcher, and other authorities. There
is, too, the testimony of John Adams (Alexander Smith), as recorded by
Captain Beachey, and, as additional proof of indifference and tyrannical
behaviour, there are Bligh's own letters to Peter Hayward's mother and
uncle (March 26, April 2, 1790), and W. C. Wentworth's account of his
administration as Governor of New South Wales (see <i>A Statistical
Description</i>, etc., 1819, p. 166). It cannot be gainsaid that Bligh was
a man of integrity and worth, and that he was upheld and esteemed by the
Admiralty. Morrison's Journal, though in parts corroborated by Bligh's
MS. Journal, is not altogether convincing, and the testimony of John
Adams in his old age counts for little. But according to his own
supporters he "damned" his men though not the officers, and his own
<i>Narrative</i>, as well as Morrison's Journal, proves that he was
suspicious, and that he underrated and misunderstood the character and
worth of his subordinates. He was responsible for the prolonged sojourn
at Tahiti, and he should have remembered that time and distance are
powerful solvents, and that between Portsmouth Hard and the untracked
waters of the Pacific, "all Arcadia" had intervened. He was a man of
imperfect sympathies, wanting in tact and fineness, but in the hour of
need he behaved like a hero, and saved himself and others by submission
to duty and strenuous self-control. Moreover, he "helped England" not
once or twice, "in the brave days of old." (See <i>A</i> <i>Narrative, etc.</i>,

your officers and men are now in the boat; and you must go with them; if
you attempt to make the least resistance you will instantly be put to
death;' and without any farther ceremony, holding me by the cord that
tied my hands, with a tribe of armed ruffians about me, I was forced
over the side, where they untied my hands. Being in the boat, we were
veered astern by a rope. A few pieces of pork were thrown to me and some
clothes.... After having undergone a great deal of ridicule, and being
kept for some time to make sport for these unfeeling wretches, we were
at length cast adrift in the open ocean.... When they were forcing me
out of the ship, I asked him [Christian] if this treatment was a proper
return for the many instances he had received of my friendship? He
appeared disturbed at the question, and answered, with much emotion,
'That,&mdash;Captain Bligh,&mdash;that is the thing;&mdash;I am in hell&mdash;I am in
hell.'"&mdash;<i>A Narrative, etc.</i>, 1790, pp. 4-8.
</p><p>
Bligh's testimony on this point does not correspond with Morrison's
journal, or with the evidence of the master, John Fryer, given at the
court-martial, September 12, 1792. According to Morrison, when the
boatswain tried to pacify Christian, he replied, "It is too late, I have
been in hell for this fortnight past, and am determined to bear it no
longer." The master's version is that he appealed to Christian, and that
Christian exclaimed, "Hold your tongue, sir, I have been in hell for
weeks past; Captain Bligh has brought all this on himself." Bligh seems
to have flattered himself that in the act of mutiny Christian was seized
with remorse, but it is clear that the wish was father to the thought.
Moreover, on being questioned, Fryer, who was a supporter of the
captain, explained that Christian referred to quarrels, to abuse in
general, and more particularly to a recent accusation of stealing
cocoa-nuts. (See <i>The Eventful History</i>, etc., 1831, pp. 84, 208,
209.)]</p></div>

["Whilst we were talking of <i>Vav&aacute;oo t&oacute;oa Lico</i>, the women said to us,
'Let us repair to the back of the island to contemplate the setting sun:
there let us listen to the warbling of the birds, and the cooing of the
wood-pigeon. We will gather flowers from the burying-place at <i>Mat&aacute;wto</i>,
and partake of refreshments prepared for us at <i>Lico O'n[)e]</i>: we will
then bathe in the sea, and rinse ourselves in the <i>V&aacute;oo A'ca</i>; we will
anoint our skins in the sun with sweet-scented oil, and will plait in
wreaths the flowers gathered at <i>Mat&aacute;wto</i>.' And now as we stand
motionless on the eminence over <i>Anoo M&aacute;noo</i>, the whistling of the wind
among the branches of the lofty <i>toa</i> shall fill us with a pleasing
melancholy; or our minds shall be seized with astonishment as we behold
the roaring surf below, endeavouring but in vain to tear away the firm
rocks. Oh! how much happier shall we be thus employed, than when engaged
in the troublesome and insipid cares of life!

"Now as night comes on, we must return to the <i>Mo&oacute;a</i>. But hark!&mdash;hear
you not the sound of the mats?&mdash;they are practising a <i>bo-o&oacute;la</i> ['a kind
of dance performed by torch-light'], to be performed to-night on the
<i>mal&aacute;i</i>, at <i>Tan&eacute;a</i>. Let us also go there. How will that scene of
rejoicing call to our minds the many festivals held there, before
<i>Vavdoo</i> was torn to pieces by war! Alas! how destructive is war!
Behold! how it has rendered the land productive of weeds, and opened
untimely graves for departed heroes! Our chiefs can now no longer enjoy
the sweet pleasure of wandering alone by moonlight in search of their
mistresses. But let us banish sorrow from our hearts: since we are at
war, we must think and act like the natives of <i>Fiji</i>, who first taught
us this destructive art. Let us therefore enjoy the present time, for
to-morrow perhaps, or the next day, we may die. We will dress ourselves
with <i>chi coola</i>, and put bands of white <i>t&aacute;ppa</i> round our waists. We
will plait thick wreaths of <i>jiale</i> for our heads, and prepare strings
of <i>hooni</i> for our necks, that their whiteness may show off the colour
of our skins. Mark how the uncultivated spectators are profuse of their
applause! But now the dance is over: let us remain here to-night and
feast and be cheerful, and to-morrow we will depart for the Mooa. How
troublesome are the young men, begging for our wreaths of flowers! while
they say in their flattery, 'See how charming these young girls look
coming from <i>Licoo</i>!&mdash;how beautiful are their skins, diffusing around a
fragrance like the flowering precipice of <i>Mataloco</i>:&mdash;Let us also visit

prepared from the roots and stems of a kind of pepper (<i>Piper
methysticum</i>). Mariner (<i>An Account, etc.</i>, 1817, ii. 183-206) gives a
highly interesting and suggestive account of the process of brewing the
kava, and of the solemn "kava-drinking," which was attended with
ceremonial rites. Briefly, a large wooden bowl, about three feet in
diameter, and one foot in depth in the centre (see, for a typical
specimen, King Thakombau's kava-bowl, in the British Museum), is placed
in front of the king or chief, who sits in the midst, surrounded by his
guests and courtiers. A portion of kava root is handed to each person
present, who chews it to a pulp, and then deposits his quid in the kava
bowl. Water being gradually added, the roots are well squeezed and
twisted by various "curvilinear turns" of the hands and arms through the
"fow," <i>i.e.</i> shavings of fibrous bark. When the "kava is in the cup,"
quaighs made of the "unexpanded leaf of the banana" are handed round to
the guests, and the symposium begins. Mariner (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 205, note)
records a striking feature of the preliminary rites, a consecration or
symbolic "grace before" drinking. "When a god has no priest, as
Tali-y-Toob&oacute; [the Supreme Deity of the Tongans], no person ... presides
at the head of his cava circle, the place being left ... vacant, but
which it is supposed the god invisibly occupies.... And they go through
the usual form of words, as if the first cup was actually filled and
presented to the god: thus, before any cup is filled, the man by the
side of the bowl says ... 'The cava is in the cup:' the mataboole
answers ... 'Give it to our god:' but this is mere form, for there is no
cup filled for the god." (See, too, <i>The Making of Religion</i>, by A.
Lang, 1900, p. 279.)]</p></div>

but was living at Stromness in 1780 (where his father's house, "The
White House," is still shown), when, on the homeward voyage of the
Resolution, Cook and Bligh were hospitably entertained by his parents.
He was of honourable descent. His mother's ancestors were sprung from a
half-brother of Mary Stuart's, and his father's family dated back to
1400. When he was at Timor, Bligh gave a "description of the pirates"
for purposes of identification by the authorities at Calcutta and
elsewhere. "George Stewart, midshipman, aged 23 years, is five feet
seven inches high, good complexion, dark hair, slender made ... small
face, and black eyes; tatowed on the left breast with a star," etc.
Lieutenant Bligh took Stewart with him, partly in return for the
"civilities" at Stromness, but also because "he was a seaman, and had
always borne a good character." Alexander Smith told Captain Beachey
(<i>Narrative of a Voyage to the Pacific</i>, 1831, Part I. p. 53) that it
was Stewart who advised Christian "to take possession of the ship," but
Peter Hayward, who survived to old age, strenuously maintained that this
was a calumny, that Stewart was forcibly detained in his cabin, and that
he would not, in any case, have taken part in the mutiny. He had,
perhaps, already wooed and won a daughter of the isles, and when the
<i>Bounty</i> revisited Tahiti, September 20, 1789, he was put ashore, and
took up his quarters in her father's house. There he remained till
March, 1791, when he "voluntarily surrendered himself" to the captain of
the <i>Pandora</i>, and was immediately put in irons. The story of his
parting from his bride is told in <i>A Missionary Voyage to the Southern
Pacific Ocean in the Ship Duff</i> (by W. Wilson), 1799, p. 360: "The
history of Peggy Stewart marks a tenderness of heart that never will be
heard without emotion.... They had lived with the old chief in the most
tender state of endearment; a beautiful little girl had been the fruit
of their union, and was at the breast when the Pandora arrived....
Frantic with grief, the unhappy Peggy ... flew with her infant in a
canoe to the arms of her husband. She was separated from him by
violence, and conveyed on shore in a state of despair and grief too big
for utterance ... she sank into the deepest dejection, pined under a
rapid decay ... and fell a victim to her feelings, dying literally of a
broken heart." Stewart was drowned or killed by an accident during the
wreck of the <i>Pandora</i>, August 29, 1791. <i>Sunt lacrym&aelig; rerum!</i> It is a
mournful tale.]</p></div>

of Charles Christian, an attorney, of Moreland Close, in the parish of
Brigham, Cumberland. His family, which was of Manx extraction, was
connected with the Christians of Ewanrigg, and the Curwens of Workington
Hall. His brother Edward became Chief Justice of Ely, and was well known
as the editor of <i>Blackstones Commentaries</i>. For purposes of
verification (see <i>An Answer to certain Assertions, etc.</i>, 1794, p. 9),
Bligh described him as "aged 24 years, five feet nine inches high,
blackish or very dark brown complexioned, dark brown hair, strong made,
star tatowed on the left breast," etc. According to "Morrison's
Journal," high words had passed between Bligh and Christian on more than
one occasion, and, on the day before the mutiny, a question having
arisen with regard to the disappearance of some cocoa-nuts, Christian
was cross-examined by the captain as to his share of the plunder. "I
really do not know, sir," he replied; "but I hope you do not think me so
mean as to be guilty of stealing yours." "Yes," said Bligh, "you &mdash;&mdash;
hound, I do think so, or you could have given a better account of them."
It was after this offensive accusation that Christian determined, in the
first instance, to quit the ship, and on the morning of April 28, 1788,
finding the mate of the watch asleep, on the spur of the moment resolved
to lay violent hands on the captain, and assume the command of the
<i>Bounty</i>. The language attributed to Bligh reads like a translation into
the vernacular, but if Christian kept his designs to himself, it is
strange that they were immediately understood and acted upon by a body
of impromptu conspirators. Testimony, whether written or spoken, with
regard to the succession of events "in moments like to these," is worth
very little; but it is pretty evident that Christian was a gentleman,
and that Bligh's violent and unmannerly ratings were the immediate cause
of the mutiny.
</p><p>
Contradictory accounts are given of Christian's death. It is generally
believed that in the fourth year of the settlement on Pitcairn Island
the Tahitians formed a plot to massacre the Englishmen, and that
Christian was shot when at work in his plantation (<i>The Mutineers,
etc.</i>, by Lady Belcher, 1870, p. 163; <i>The Mutiny, etc.</i>, by Rosalind A.
Young, 1894, p. 28). On the other hand, Amasa Delano, in his <i>Narrative
of Voyages, etc.</i> (Boston, 1817, cap. v. p. 140), asserts that Captain
Mayhew Folger, who was the first to visit the island in 1808, "was very
explicit in his inquiry at the time, as well as in his account of it to
me, that they lived under Christian's government several years after
they landed; that during the whole time they enjoyed tolerable harmony;
that Christian became sick, and died a natural death." It stands to
reason that the ex-pirate, Alexander Smith, who had developed into John
Adams, the pious founder of a patriarchal colony, would be anxious to
draw a veil over the early years of the settlement, and would satisfy
the curiosity of visitors who were officers of the Royal Navy, as best
he could, and as the spirit moved him.]</p></div>

be found in the ninth chapter of "Mariner's Account of the Tonga
Islands" [1817, i. 267-279]. I have taken the poetical liberty to
transplant it to Toobonai, the last island where any distinct account is
left of Christian and his comrades.
</p><p>
[The following is the account given by Mariner: "On this island [Hoonga]
there is a peculiar cavern, which was first discovered by a young chief,
whilst diving after a turtle. The nature of this cavern will be better
understood if we imagine a hollow rock rising sixty feet or more above
the surface of the water, into the cavity of which there is no known
entrance but one, and that is on the side of the rock, as low down as
six feet under the water, into which it flows; and, consequently, the
base of the cavern may be said to be the sea itself." Mariner seeing
some young chiefs diving into the water one after another, and not rise
again, he inquired of the last, ... what they were about? "'Follow me,'"
said he, "'and I will take you where you have never been before....'"
Mariner prepared to follow his companion, and, guided by the light
reflected from his heels, entered the opening in the rock, and rose into
the cavern. The light was sufficient, after remaining about five
minutes, to show objects with some little distinctness; ...
Nevertheless, as it was desirable to have a stronger light, Mariner
dived out again, and, priming his pistol, tied plenty of gnatoo tight
round it, and wrapped the whole up in a plantain-leaf: he directed an
attendant to bring a torch in the same way. Thus prepared, he re-entered
the cavern, unwrapped the gnatoo, fired it by the flash of the powder,
and lighted the torch. "The place was now illuminated tolerably well....
It appeared (by guess) to be about forty feet wide in the main part, but
it branched off, on one side, in two narrower portions. The medium
height seemed also about forty feet. The roof was hung with stalactites
in a very curious way, resembling, upon a cursory view, the Gothic
arches and ornaments of an old church." According to one of the
matabooles present, the entire family of a certain chief had, in former
times, been condemned to death for conspiring against a rival
tyrant&mdash;the chief to be taken out to sea and drowned, the rest of the
family to be massacred. One of the chiefs daughters was a beautiful
girl, to whom the youth who discovered the cave was attached. "He had
long been enamoured of this young maiden, but had never dared to make
her acquainted with the soft emotions of his heart, knowing that she was
betrothed to a chief of higher rank and greater power, but now, ... no
time was to be lost; he flew to her abode ... declared himself her
deliverer if she would trust to his honour.... Soon her consenting hand
was clasped in his: the shades of evening favoured their escape ... till
her lover had brought a small canoe to a lonely part of the beach. In
this they speedily embarked.... They soon arrived at the rock, he leaped
into the water, and she, instructed by him, followed close after; they
rose into the cavern, and rested from their fatigue, partaking of some
refreshments which he had brought there for himself...." Here she
remained, visited from time to time by her more fortunate Leander, until
he was enabled to carry her off to the Fiji islands, where they dwelt
till the death of the tyrant, when they returned to Vavaoo, "and lived
long in peace and happiness."]</p></div>

buried twenty years), he opened his arms to receive her.

[The story is told by Bayle, who quotes from a manuscript chronicle of
Tours, preserved in the notes of Andreas Quercetanus, affixed to the

there is a singular relation of a young Frenchman, who with his mistress
appeared to be of some rank. He enlisted and deserted at Schweidnitz;
and after a desperate resistance was retaken, having killed an officer,
who attempted to seize him after he was wounded, by the discharge of his
musket loaded with a <i>button</i> of his uniform. Some circumstances on his
court-martial raised a great interest amongst his judges, who wished to
discover his real situation in life, which he offered to disclose, but
to the king only, to whom he requested permission to write. This was
refused, and Frederic was filled with the greatest indignation, from
baffled curiosity or some other motive, when he understood that his
request had been denied. [<i>Mes Souvenirs de vingt ans de s&eacute;jour &agrave;
